" Freshwater fish only drink water through the skin via Osmosis, Saltwater fish drink water through the mouth. Dolphins are friendly to human beings.", Happy
 Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!, Happy
 no but I would love to! paying hourly to hang out with adorable cats? im in!, Happy
" i guess thats where the phrase ""cat nap"" comes from", Happy
 I love to dance a lot. How about you?, Happy
 Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?, Happy
 Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye, Happy
 Yes and did get used so that is good. Nice chat, Happy
" Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.", Happy
 They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you., Happy
 I do like comic books!, Happy
" I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with ""excelsior!""", Happy
 I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas., Happy
 The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!, Happy
" I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!", Happy
" I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!", Happy
 That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets., Happy
 It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!, Happy
 Hahah That's a good way of putting it! , Happy
" I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. ", Happy
" I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. ", Happy
" Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!", Happy
" I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.", Happy
" Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!", Happy
" Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.", Happy
" Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.", Happy
 I like that too. nice chat, Happy
 Hello, Happy
 And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!, Happy
 I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges., Happy
 Thanks., Happy
" They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?", Happy
" haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it", Happy
" I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, ""Gimme back my child"" look!", Happy
" With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?", Happy
" Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do.", Happy
" I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, ""12 angry hamsters""", Happy
 Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda. , Happy
" Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. ", Happy
" Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease...", Happy
" Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?", Happy
" Too many to count. We've had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...", Happy
 I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend, Happy
 Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing, Happy
" That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more.", Happy
" I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.", Happy
 Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.  , Happy
 Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!, Happy
 Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert., Happy
 Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!, Happy
" haha yeah, I heard about that. It's been there since 1968.", Happy
" They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.", Happy
" Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards", Happy
" nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.", Happy
 There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!, Happy
 Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!, Happy
 You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!, Happy
 Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes., Happy
 Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie., Happy
 On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?, Happy
 I agree.  It's sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!, Happy
 I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night., Happy
 Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline., Happy
 Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director., Happy
" Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!", Happy
 Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!, Happy
" Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol", Happy
 You too! Have a good night!!, Happy
" He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. ", Happy
" The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!", Happy
 I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed., Happy
 I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time., Happy
 Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing., Happy
 Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot., Happy
 I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol, Happy
 I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!, Happy
" lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!", Happy
 No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day., Happy
 Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting!, Happy
 You have a great weekend too!, Happy
 Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!, Happy
 I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha, Happy
 I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school, Happy
" Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.", Happy
" yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait!", Happy
" hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!", Happy
" I have never heard of Fanfest,", Happy
" I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol", Happy
 But would you categorize them as an art form?, Happy
" I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.", Happy
 Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL, Happy
" Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun", Happy
 Agreed! Nice chatting with you!, Happy
 I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you., Happy
 Nice chatting with you too!, Happy
" That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?", Happy
" Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ", Happy
 I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?, Happy
" I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private!", Happy
" Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. ", Happy
 Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!, Happy
" Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!", Happy
 It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS., Happy
" Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances!", Happy
" Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!!", Happy
 They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer, Happy
" Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft", Happy
" Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world! ", Happy
 It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift., Happy
 that is a lot!, Happy
 We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!!, Happy
" that is good! Hey, do you like animals?", Happy
" Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named ""white Shark cafe"". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!", Happy
" We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!", Happy
 Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!!, Happy
 Must have been tough being the only guy., Happy
" I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,", Happy
 I never knew that.  There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853., Happy
 That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then., Happy
 I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting., Happy
 That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time., Happy
 Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do., Happy
 It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary's 1969 CA Governor campaign., Happy
 I had no idea.  Wonder why a British band at the time would write a song for an American election?  Interesting., Happy
 I didn't know that.  I've heard about when they did that though to those people., Happy
 In 1934 I see that North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I'm learning all kinds of new things today., Happy
 Looks like Texas was ahead of the times!  Thanks for chatting!, Happy
" Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!", Happy
" Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.", Happy
 I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star., Happy
 You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie., Happy
" Yes, I love my ROKU.", Happy
" I would definitely. You can also get Netflick, Hulu. I have Amazon Prime which has lots of channels.", Happy
 Did you know that has sold over an estimated 5 billion copies?  Wow., Happy
 Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction!, Happy
" Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection.", Happy
 Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in., Happy
" Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq.", Happy
 Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language!, Happy
" I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like ""good riddance"" and ""wild goose chase"".", Happy
 Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Interesting facts., Happy
" Yes!  lol  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  I never knew that.", Happy
 I love going to libraries!  I'm a heavy user of them.  It's been fun chatting with you!, Happy
 Same thing to you. Good day., Happy
 You have a good day too!, Happy
 That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books., Happy
" I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?", Happy
" I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!", Happy
 And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way., Happy
" Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""  ", Happy
" Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican.", Happy
 If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater., Happy
" I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised.", Happy
 Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video., Happy
 A lot of athletes have used ballet and now yoga to help with flexibility and reduce injuries!, Happy
" Yes, I hear it does help tremendously.", Happy
" I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!", Happy
" Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves", Happy
 I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people, Happy
" Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting. ", Happy
 Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%, Happy
 Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes, Happy
 I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high, Happy
 true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?, Happy
 Same here. Thought it was very interesting, Happy
 same. have a good day, Happy
 bye, Happy
" Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will. ", Happy
 I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many., Happy
 That's refreshing... I can see why ABC Family was mentioned. , Happy
 Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music., Happy
" I remember as kids we'd have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?", Happy
" If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!, ", Happy
" Yes I have. Doesn't that guy have a Scottish accent or something? And I think he thought he was going to be the actual voice, very strange.", Happy
" No I think that they don't really pick the best movies. A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated. I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though, I'm glad that he won three times for best actor", Happy
 That is just sad. I hope we move towards behaving as we should with each other. Nice chat :), Happy
" Hi, Yes I am a star wars fan!!! Since I was a kid. What about you?", Happy
" It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive!", Happy
" It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions!", Happy
" Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire", Happy
" I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so", Happy
 She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job, Happy
" Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing!", Happy
 You do the same!!, Happy
 He seems to really be an animal lover too. , Happy
" oh yes, I even watched the first ""Nosferatu"" movie - not sure when that was made but it's quite old...", Happy
" That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror?", Happy
" He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy.", Happy
" I haven't seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You've got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down.", Happy
 We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do., Happy
 I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;), Happy
 Absolutely ;) no argument here ;), Happy
" If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you.", Happy
" Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)", Happy
 That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that's very nice of them, Happy
 You're right. I do love that movie a lot though. It's a great winter movie. Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy. He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down, Happy
" Same here, have a good one.", Happy
" It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha!", Happy
" Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though!", Happy
" That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL", Happy
 Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him, Happy
" Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that's nice thing to do", Happy
" That's a very nice and humane thing to do! He's certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn't he?", Happy
 Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later., Happy
" They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies.", Happy
" Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they're going to do even better next year", Happy
" Yes, they do.  On another note, did you know that the rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25", Happy
 I absolutely love his music!, Happy
 I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that., Happy
" Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it.", Happy
" That's funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row.", Happy
" I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.", Happy
" Hi, do you know anything about lacrosse?", Happy
 Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?, Happy
" Yeah, the US open. Seems like they should have been more prepared.", Happy
 Agreed. I work in recreation facilities and would not have thought of calling in a helicopter for any of my isssues., Happy
" I would have fallen asleep, all three days! Nice chatting with you!", Happy
 Hello there. Have you ever played the guitar or piano?, Happy
 I have heard that. Hendrix set his guitar on fire at Woodstock., Happy
" That just shows how badass they are, haha! The best guitarists are the ones that set stuff on fire from playing... or have a phd in astrophysics like the one from Queen.", Happy
 Yes. He is a smart guy., Happy
 Its a great musical instrument, Happy
 it should be in the rock and roll hall of fame, Happy
 A long time ago at the fillmore east I saw grand funk railroad. Talk about loud and sparks flying, Happy
" Were an American band, Im your Captain, Some kind of wonderful, are some hits they had in the 1970s", Happy
 Mark Farner i think was lead guitar, Happy
 Nice! Well thank you for opening up my ears to some new awesome music. Now i got some new stuff to listen to. It's been a pleasure chatting with you about guitars and piano's. :), Happy
 The Hypocrites put on really amusing stage productions!, Happy
" Yes, I would love to go and check Pirates, Pinafore and the Mikado", Happy
 That is a living dream. A pajama party and a live satirical operetta with talented musician clowns. that is something else, Happy
 It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics, Happy
" They play with music and even with toys. They did release beach balls in pirates of penzance, fun", Happy
 They also swap genders in the production of Pinafore., Happy
" the price is not expensive, $30 to $74", Happy
 How much do you like jazz, Happy
" I dig it.    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States", Happy
" It  is fascinating, comes from ragtime and blues and it is called the Classical music of America", Happy
 It did spread around the world and gave origin to different styles around the world, Happy
 Great! I also love the dance-oriented swing big bands like the Kansas city jazz, Happy
" Cool, it is funny that rapper Tupac Shakur studied jazz, acting and poetry.. but became a rapper.", Happy
 Yes.  Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan!, Happy
 Neat!  I bet that is a pain to drag up the guitars and piano  up there., Happy
 Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks., Happy
 Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff., Happy
 Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody that Paul McCartney used to record Hey Jude., Happy
 Good talking to you!, Happy
" Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime.", Happy
" Yes, hmmm seems like MJ's songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd's houseboat called Astroria!  It's a recording studio.", Happy
 You too! Good chat!!, Happy
 Yes. Honestly all of Queen always struck me as a very intelligent group of men. I am also a big fan. , Happy
 I did not. It's been so long that I honestly can't remember what that sounded like. I wonder where the iPhone ring tone came from because I hear that everywhere lol. , Happy
" I had not heard that but it's actually quite touching that he could find a way. Speaking of piano, Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude.", Happy
 Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play?, Happy
 I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy., Happy
 I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast., Happy
 Wow.  I didn't know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting., Happy
 lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol, Happy
 I'm a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then., Happy
 When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of the web traffic with it.  I don't remember that., Happy
 I didn't know that.  I know at one time they used hundreds of live goats to mow the lawns around their headquarters.  They really like their animals., Happy
 I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then., Happy
 Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!, Happy
 It was good chatting with you!, Happy
 Yes. Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or doubles., Happy
" Yes, It is more comfortable to wear while playing, and it also make the popular of the shirts.", Happy
 Google was founded in 1998. It is an American multinational technology company that is specialized in internet-related services., Happy
" It is the biggest search engine and cloud computing service. It also many application like gmail, youtube, etc...", Happy
 It is very interesting thing. Technology are used to identify were are we. It affect the privacy of person., Happy
 Do you like tennis? I just love to play the sport., Happy
 i love it! Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams, Happy
 Do you like Starship Troopers?  , Happy
 I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies. , Happy
" That's interesting!  What a job to have!  That's just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar! ", Happy
" I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you.", Happy
 The Loch Ness monster should have legal rights to! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet Earth. I have no idea how many zeros that is but I know it is a lot LOL, Happy
 We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken., Happy
 I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool., Happy
 THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years, Happy
 Very cool. Pigeons are very pretty birds., Happy
 Oh yeah! I pick up a racket and hit the net when I can!, Happy
 Nice!  Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players?, Happy
 Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since., Happy
" Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality. ", Happy
" Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!", Happy
" She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal.", Happy
 That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open., Happy
 lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport., Happy
 That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow!, Happy
 Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol, Happy
 Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast!  lol  It's been fun chatting with you!, Happy
 I'll have to look him up!  Have a great night!, Happy
 I really like her! , Happy
 That is interesting! Did you know in Tennis years ago you were allowed to use any object as your racket? Haha, Happy
 Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!, Happy
" Wow, I could never last that long! Speaking of Serena Williams, I didn't know she went pro at age 13! That is amazing....and she is co owner of the Miami Dolphins...wow!", Happy
 That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him!, Happy
 True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha!, Happy
" Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician!", Happy
 Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been!, Happy
" So true. And speaking of Eminem, it's hilarious the judge who was trying a suit against Eminem back in 2001 delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Glad some judges still have a sense of humor. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care!", Happy
 You have a good evening as well. I'm off to watch the Rugrats movie to see if I recognize Busta Rhymes' voice in it as the Reptar wagon. Ha! Take care!, Happy
" Yep you're right about that. Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him", Happy
" Yeah, he's definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease", Happy
" Yes, mostly they are meant to make fun of other people LOL but I think a compliment battle is actually a very smart thing and would promote positivity", Happy
" Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. Do you know ?", Happy
 Scientists recently found a human print inside a ground sloth's paw marks., Happy
" NIce! Animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, But humans cannot.", Happy
" Yes, But there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.", Happy
 Yes. Both human and animals are live together. I make our eco-system. The special branch of science to study animals is called zoology., Happy
 There are about 20 quintillion animals on planet earth., Happy
" In 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species.", Happy
 Alaska has had a cat named stubbs as its mayor since 1997., Happy
 There are cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks., Happy
" Yes, Its very naughty and its one of family memebers.", Happy
" I also have a cat, Ive always wondered what breed it is since there are over 70 breeds registered.", Happy
 Amazing! Its very nice to hear this., Happy
 Do you like Tennis?, Happy
 I didn't know she did that.  She speaks fluent French and Italian., Happy
" That is interesting.  Tupac Shakur's music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance""", Happy
 I didn't know that.  In 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world., Happy
 lol true!  Big Mac sounds like it would be a good rapper name.  Eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist before he was a rapper., Happy
" I know right?  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle rap called ""compliment battle""  Never heard of that before.", Happy
 I didn't know that.  In 2001 a Michigan judge delivered a ruling in the form of a rap when judging over a suit filed against Eminem.  I bet that was funny to hear in the court room., Happy
 I agree.  It's always so quiet during tennis matches., Happy
 That would have been interesting.  Polo shirts were originally invented bor tennis and later adopted for polo players., Happy
" I just admire Serena for speaking up for women's rights, even though it comes at a great personal cost to her. She truly is a warrior for women.", Happy
 I agree.  In 1998 she shaid that both she and her sister Venus could beat any man ranked 200 or worse.  , Happy
 You know it!  , Happy
 yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production, Happy
 Thats some sound advice! His Gold Digger song was really fun to listen to but thats about it., Happy
 I really enjoyed the soundtrack of Moana. Beauty and the Beast also had a pretty good one., Happy
" I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you?", Happy
" Ah, the infamous k-pop. I have listened to some of that here and there.", Happy
 It was nice chatting with you too! Thank you for you time!, Happy
 I love them! some of my favorites. how about you?, Happy
 oh probably the Episode 1 podracer game. that was a goood one. I cant believe how successful its become after George Lucas made that one movie way back in the 70s, Happy
 thats awesome. Did you know Ewan McGregors brother goes by Obi-Two?, Happy
" I played the old Super Star Wars games on the SNES, and Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox. Those games were awesome", Happy
" James Cameron decided to join the film industry after watching star wars, he drected those 2 films", Happy
" Oh, really? That is really interesting.", Happy
" I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long!", Happy
" It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?", Happy
" It's very scary to think about, hopefully we don't.", Happy
 It's very interesting. It's amazing how long the earth has sustained life., Happy
" Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?", Happy
 I think it's great to learn about. , Happy
 That is awesome! I seen something about starship troopers is the only science fiction novel that is used by three of the five branches in the us military., Happy
" Yeah me either! A judge in 1950's tried to ban science fiction comics. Get this, because there was a black character! ", Happy
" I know right! haha, well it was nice talking to you, I've got to fix dinner now. Bye! :)", Happy
" Great! Did you know that Oscar Isaac requested that his character in The Force Awakens be from Yavin 4, because he's from Guatemala and that's where the Yavin 4 scenes were shot in the original trilogy?", Happy
" Huh, he didn't win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo. ", Happy
" You would think. It is sad. For the original Star Wars movie, James Earl jones only got paid $7500 and recorded all of his lines in just 2 and a half hours. Talk about a bargain. ", Happy
" And that's after they studio thought it was going to flop, so Lucas gave up his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights. Maybe one of the best business decisions ever made!", Happy
" Seems like it was over a billion. Back to Lucas's wife -- she had a lot of the best ideas for the original movie, like Obi Wan's death. ", Happy
 I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss..., Happy
 And re-edited the trench run scene to make it more suspenseful. Those are some big contributions. Much deserving of the editing Oscar. , Happy
 Totally agree. I did LOVE the spin-off Rogue One though from 2016. That one felt like a true Star Wars movie from back i the day. , Happy
 I did like that one. I thought that had a good story and nice acting. There's a reason why they are the most successful film merchandising franchise!, Happy
 Definitely. I also like the diversity of the films. Did you know in the 1950's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because one of the characters was black? Crazy. , Happy
" The 50's were a different time, unfortunately. One of the first sci-fi stories is thought to be from ancient Greece, over 1800 years ago, about plant-based aliens living on the moon.", Happy
 Haha. Isaac Asimov coined the term Robots in 1941. I'd have thought it was much older than that. , Happy
 Yeah. That seems young. Nice chatting with you!, Happy
 travel the world and explore as many countries as possible . and you?, Happy
" Yes, I rod a once, I was raised on a farm and all my friends had a horse except me.", Happy
 THey are such gentle creatures. Nice chatting with you., Happy
 I think the same. It was good talking to you too!, Happy
 Hello. Do you play any video games?, Happy
" Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.  ", Happy
" Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden.", Happy
 Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one?, Happy
 I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio., Happy
 THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game., Happy
 Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though. I was typing a lot for work when I got it., Happy
" Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL.", Happy
 I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed?, Happy
 He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That's what Canadians call kickball., Happy
 Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic., Happy
 I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius!, Happy
" ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July", Happy
 Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him., Happy
" I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx.", Happy
" oh wow ya I'm glad I didn't get that, I just use Netflix and thats enough for me", Happy
 I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content!, Happy
 I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features., Happy
" Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones! ", Happy
" Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous.", Happy
 Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact! , Happy
" Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!", Happy
 Me too. I love Top Gun., Happy
 It was great chatting., Happy
 Did you know the china wall was very large and famous in the world., Happy
 I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great., Happy
 Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha, Happy
 tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind., Happy
 Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language., Happy
 I watch all 7 seasons. it's all are good., Happy
 good morning to you, Happy
 Good morning! Are a fan of The Simpsons? Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them. , Happy
" They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes. ", Happy
" Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour. ", Happy
 I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college. , Happy
" I'd say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so. ", Happy
 No. Couldn't even finish the one I started. Canada's first official currency was playing cards! Now that's cool. , Happy
" Haha. Hawaii passed single payer healthcare in 2009, but the governor wouldn't sign it into law. If only the rest of the country would follow suit - and then pass it into law. ", Happy
" Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels. ", Happy
" No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals", Happy
 It seems like a strange coincidence? , Happy
" Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi.", Happy
 Okay now I understand. He'd make a good mascot for the Demos., Happy
 True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?, Happy
 She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to?, Happy
 And she owns a private jet!, Happy
" Yes,it was funny.  Do you know that Foxnews tried to sue the Simpsons?", Happy
 Me too. It was good talking to you., Happy
 That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy?, Happy
 True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation., Happy
 Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950's because it featured a black character. , Happy
 I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals., Happy
" Surprisingly, the Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and they only wore black for special occasions.  I'm so used to seeing them stereotyped wearing black and white.", Happy
" I would hope so.  lol  I guess it depends on your body type, etc.", Happy
 Have a good night., Happy
" I enjoy both fiction and non, however, I espcially like fiction books that have fact along with some imagination sprinkled in.", Happy
 I am a fan somewhat!  I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino., Happy
 Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.  In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then., Happy
 I didn't know that.  There's a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities., Happy
 I don't know.  We'll have to go look on wikipedia.  lol  I know someone who was the best one year though in literature and that was in 1953 when Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature., Happy
 Nope.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I wonder how they judged that?, Happy
 Hmmm.....that I don't know.  I think it was some girl named ...Anne?, Happy
 I didn't know that.  I wonder if any of the pieces are worth money now as collectibles?, Happy
 I always seem to remember school portraying them to wear black and white.  Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says Made in China.  I'm not familiar with that brand.  They sound shady to me., Happy
 It was fun and nice chatting with you as well!, Happy
 I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me!, Happy
 For me my pets have always been family. I care for them more than I do some people I know., Happy
 That's probably why they're so popular worldwide!, Happy
" Good question.  Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans", Happy
" When they first cloned a cat, they named it copy cat.  Haha", Happy
" Haha, that's good stuff there.  It is not legal to ""own"" pets in boulder, colorado, but you may be their ""guardian.""", Happy
" Wow, that's an interesting fact.  Check this out. In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15", Happy
" Yes, flow and delivery.", Happy
 Not really!  lol  I guess I do as long as they leave me alone., Happy
 Nice!  I didn't know that.  Only 70 percent of the worlds snakes lay eggs., Happy
 Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth., Happy
" Yikes!  I don't want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That's creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes?????", Happy
 I know right?  I'm going to have to google it.  A man has been bitten so many times by snakes that his blood is able to be used as antivenom.  I wouldn't want to be him., Happy
 I believe it.  I jump and shout when I see one. lol  Australia is the only continent where ven9omous snakes outnumber the non-venomous ones., Happy
" Those salt water crocs. I wouldn't want to cross paths with either from there. lol  Some owls keep blind snakes in their nests as helpful associates, reducing the abundance of nest parasites.  How interesting is that?  ...and how do they know they are blind? lol", Happy
 That's interesting!  Do you happen to read any fiction at all?, Happy
 I didn't know that.  The term robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1941., Happy
" Hi, how are you?", Happy
 I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out., Happy
" Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It's with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one?", Happy
" lynn's novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women's minds and lives", Happy
 There's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities., Happy
 Couldn't it be both? Couldn't her looks be a power and a liability when she uses them inappropriately?, Happy
 Her beauty is part of her underlying charatcher which allows her to have so many more dimensions than just beauty., Happy
 I always question how the author should portray the protaginist in her own books... What's appropriate for the author is not for the reader. , Happy
 Nice chatting with you., Happy
 I do like comics. I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it., Happy
" He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination!", Happy
 And in 2001 a judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Stay in your lane your honor!, Happy
 Nice chatting with you!, Happy
 WOW! I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar., Happy
 I am wondering about it too. He called it the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy. Nice chat :), Happy
" Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though!", Happy
 I love comedy. It's my favorite., Happy
 good morning., Happy
 Yeah I love a good comedy., Happy
 Me too!  Did you see Bill Murray's Kung Fu Hustle?, Happy
 I think I may have seen it. I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though., Happy
 I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.  , Happy
 I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies., Happy
 I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason., Happy
 Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny., Happy
" Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.", Happy
 considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising., Happy
" Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.", Happy
 Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though., Happy
 Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is?, Happy
 Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money., Happy
" Holy smokes!  You're not kidding!  Did you know Disney's animation studios almost shut down after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a box office failure?", Happy
" It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty.", Happy
" I would think so too.  However it wasn't their biggest flop.  That would have been ""Treasure Planet"" which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time!", Happy
 I dont think I even saw that one., Happy
" I remember it, but don't remember seeing it either.  Silence of the Lambs had a box office of over $270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991.", Happy
 That was a good movie. Still a classic. Have  a good one., Happy
 I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all. , Happy
" Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that.", Happy
" Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers. ", Happy
" Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance.", Happy
 I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile., Happy
" That was smart. those moves were pretty extreme, so that explains a lot of how it was done.", Happy
 That was in Hong Kong.Now I want to see if there is any footage of him dancing. Have a good day!, Happy
 I think it's incredible how easily they can fly.  It's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!, Happy
" That's funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey!", Happy
 That's a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting., Happy
 I can't dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker!, Happy
 Wow.  I had no idea he danced but I can see that going hand in hand with the karate moves., Happy
 I didn't know that.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  That could get expensive!, Happy
 Ouch!  That's all I'll say.  I would have broken toes.  Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves., Happy
" I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you!", Happy
 LOL Have a great night!, Happy
 Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;), Happy
" Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series.", Happy
" Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it !", Happy
 well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol, Happy
 Thank you.  It was nice to talk with you., Happy
 I guess they are doing well at the moment.  they went so long without winning anything and now they can't stop., Happy
" That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now?", Happy
 I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team., Happy
" England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field.", Happy
" I guess it's in the rules, that's why they wear the uniform.  I'd love to see one of those really old managers walk up to bat one day.", Happy
 Yeah.  It would be even better if that old manager knocked it out of the park.  Babe Ruth didn't look like an athlete so why not?, Happy
" He was an exceptional player, but he doesn't strike me as someone who was quick on his feet.  New York should be able to forgive him", Happy
" Guess all the curses are going away, there must be a statute of limitations on them.", Happy
" Ha!  Yes, the ""Curse of the Bambino"" apparently was rescinded.  The Sox won last...", Happy
" Nice talking with you, Go Royals!", Happy
" I learned a lot, Thanks for chatting! ", Happy
 I might have to watch a little baseball this season now lol.. take care, Happy
" Hi, how are you?", Happy
 Hi! Good!, Happy
 Do you enjoy baseball?, Happy
" I do like baseball, but I don't really follow it. How about you?", Happy
 I love it. Watch a lot of games every year and can't wait until spring training... Babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run., Happy
" Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol", Happy
 Chicago Cubs. I'm from Chicago so... Love going to Wrigley!, Happy
" O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership?", Happy
" That's a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year", Happy
 A man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic- hidden since the 1940s. , Happy
 I did. And they won in 2016 so that/s inaccurate. But it's not your fault... You've been great!, Happy
 I hope it was... At least it wasn't on national TV..., Happy
 Nice chatting with you., Happy
 Great chatting with you too! Have a good one!, Happy
 You too, Happy
 Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy., Happy
" I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course!", Happy
 I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area, Happy
" Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA?", Happy
" Funny how things get named - like golf uses clubs, but baseball uses a bat.", Happy
 Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day., Happy
" I did not know that either. I enjoy playing softball, it is a lot more fun to play recreationally than baseball.", Happy
 At least the YMCA created basketball and therefore one of the major sports leagues around today. Not bad for a recreational game they thought up., Happy
" I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports", Happy
" You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America's most famous golfer.", Happy
 Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!!, Happy
 you have a nice weekend as well. , Happy
" I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you.", Happy
 Hmm so I guess not a good spot for smokers either, Happy
" Same here, have a good one.", Happy
" No, I can't say I know a whole lot about that.  But, it's been nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day!", Happy
 Chadwick Boseman played the character Black Panther., Happy
 He also read a lot of nonfiction. Good way to get an education. No need for school. , Happy
" A man of many talents! Well, I enjoyed chatting!", Happy
" Yeah I wonder what all the party balloon companies will do to survive.  Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day!", Happy
 That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month..., Happy
" Yeah, I can barely read and here he is showing off reading that much@", Happy
" I do too!!! Well, its been good talking to you. I have to get going. Have a great day. Goodbye!", Happy
 You too!, Happy
" Yes, I've been trying to go to a lot more shows lately. I recently saw Bill Burr and he was very funny.", Happy
" That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV.", Happy
" He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!", Happy
" Yeah exactly and who's going to end phone conversations with ""excelsior"" like he did.", Happy
" Hello, are you a comedy fan?  Are you familiar with Ken Jeong's", Happy
 He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University., Happy
" Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler.", Happy
" Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though.", Happy
 I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him., Happy
" K-pop is the music which is originated in South Korea, they are more popular in 2000.", Happy
 I like how South Korea blasted K-Pop across the border to North Korea in 2010., Happy
" The north korea sank a south korean warship in 2010, south korea responded by blasting the k-pop song ""hit your heart"" across the border using large military loud speakers.", Happy
 I bet that was very annoying to listen to all day and night! Did you know even Jackie Chan manages a K-Pop boy band?, Happy
" Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, to make the movement repeat and well organised.", Happy
" Speaking of choreography, ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shows a week!", Happy
 Ballet dance is originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and it become concert dance in France and Russia., Happy
" I think it is cool that it's still around to this day. Michael Jackson has some patents on some of his dance moves, crazy!", Happy
 Dance is also represent the culture and traditional of particular region. Mostly it make our body well control and organised., Happy
 Babies are dances immediately when they hear music and make their body very flexible., Happy
" It is very interesting. Dance is art, sometime other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have dance like quality, including martial arts and physical activity.", Happy
 Birds are living world wide and there are more than ten thousand spices world wide. Birds have wings which developed more or less according to their species., Happy
 So only it make to fly very high and far away. Some times birds travel from one continent to another continent for their breed., Happy
 They really don't huh? Have a good day!, Happy
" Hi, how are you?", Happy
 I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat., Happy
 Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests?, Happy
" Yeah I love a little dog, especially one in a little sweater or a shirt! I've even seen one in a polo shirt. The polo shirt was actually invented for tennis, not polo!", Happy
" Yeah, I like them too. I have cozy sweater looking ones for the house. It's getting hot where I am already but we were blessed with another cool day. I'm going to go enjoy the evening, have a good one!", Happy
 Yes!  It is such a cool concepts.  Recycle bottles for  dog food.  How neat!, Happy
 I do!  I have one and have had one all my life since I was a kid., Happy
 Nice!  Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway!, Happy
" Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren't color blind either, just don't see the same thing we see!", Happy
 I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue., Happy
 Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad., Happy
 It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy!, Happy
 Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different., Happy
 I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons., Happy
 That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha., Happy
 Nice.  I'm thinking of a different boot then.  lol  The late musician Prince was a fantastic bowler and wore knee high furry boots while doing it., Happy
" I think I've read about that before and have seen the picture.  I think it was in Paris, France.", Happy
 You should google it.  It's pretty neat.  They are really tiny and didn't know they were in the picture., Happy
 Hi do you like to wear shirts?  I do!  I wear them every day., Happy
 Wouldn't that be awesome to go to work like that!  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers all wore blue shirts and khaki pants., Happy
 i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life, Neutral
 Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex., Neutral
" thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced", Neutral
 i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?, Neutral
 thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis? , Neutral
 Hi!  do you like to dance?, Neutral
" I am really bad, but it is a good time.", Neutral
 I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!, Neutral
" Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.", Neutral
" He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.", Neutral
 Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer., Neutral
 No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this., Neutral
" It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.", Neutral
 Bye, Neutral
 They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see, Neutral
" I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.", Neutral
" Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. ", Neutral
 $7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio., Neutral
 A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence., Neutral
" Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!", Neutral
 I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!, Neutral
" Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!", Neutral
" Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.", Neutral
" Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!", Neutral
" Naming a cloned cat ""copy cat"", that's cute.", Neutral
 Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time., Neutral
 One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?, Neutral
" Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.", Neutral
" That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy", Neutral
" Yes, I love fish do you?", Neutral
" Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?", Neutral
" Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.", Neutral
" Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?", Neutral
" I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?", Neutral
" lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species.", Neutral
" I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.", Neutral
 He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets., Neutral
 Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them., Neutral
" That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?", Neutral
 I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.  , Neutral
" Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.", Neutral
" Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?", Neutral
" Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?", Neutral
 Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?, Neutral
 Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role, Neutral
" He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. ", Neutral
 Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?, Neutral
" Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. ", Neutral
 In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons. , Neutral
" I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. ", Neutral
 Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ? , Neutral
" They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. ", Neutral
 Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things, Neutral
 There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog. , Neutral
 I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day, Neutral
" Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.", Neutral
" Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.", Neutral
 I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off. , Neutral
 did you see that Kanye is having another kid?, Neutral
 I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :), Neutral
" I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)", Neutral
" I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors.", Neutral
" They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.", Neutral
 That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities., Neutral
" Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye's middle name, Omari,. ", Neutral
" Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day.", Neutral
 Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?, Neutral
 I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania., Neutral
" They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!", Neutral
 I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor., Neutral
 Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked., Neutral
 I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!, Neutral
 Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy., Neutral
 I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years., Neutral
 Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway., Neutral
 It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots., Neutral
" Yeah, hopefully we'll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.", Neutral
 Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?, Neutral
 That is amazing and very determined.  It's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!, Neutral
" My son is, so I know a little bit about it.", Neutral
" I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.", Neutral
" It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?", Neutral
 I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!, Neutral
" Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!", Neutral
 You as well. Goodbye now!, Neutral
" Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile.", Neutral
 I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates., Neutral
" yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican", Neutral
" They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election", Neutral
" I know, id be skipping out on that election.", Neutral
" Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history.", Neutral
 It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too., Neutral
 Keep them working.  LOL, Neutral
" I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort.", Neutral
 I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!, Neutral
 For real!  Have a good one!, Neutral
 Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.  , Neutral
 I have heard of it. Do you?, Neutral
" That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work.", Neutral
" Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  ", Neutral
" Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure.", Neutral
" I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. ", Neutral
" I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. ", Neutral
" Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. ", Neutral
" Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   ", Neutral
 Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport., Neutral
" Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. ", Neutral
" Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands.", Neutral
 Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV., Neutral
" Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.", Neutral
" There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. ", Neutral
" You too, have a good evening.", Neutral
 i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?, Neutral
 I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager., Neutral
" yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.", Neutral
" Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.", Neutral
" Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?", Neutral
" Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?", Neutral
 Really? the womens game? do men play as well?, Neutral
" Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.", Neutral
 He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball. , Neutral
" Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!", Neutral
" Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?", Neutral
 that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?, Neutral
 Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent., Neutral
" Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well.", Neutral
" A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.", Neutral
 I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice., Neutral
 The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward., Neutral
 Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!, Neutral
 Have a good night, Neutral
" Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to ""de-feminize"" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/", Neutral
 Have a lovely day as well :), Neutral
 I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?, Neutral
" That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?", Neutral
 I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?, Neutral
" I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.", Neutral
" I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.", Neutral
 Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it., Neutral
" I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers.", Neutral
 It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time., Neutral
 Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps., Neutral
 That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!, Neutral
 Have a good evening!, Neutral
 Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?, Neutral
" It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.", Neutral
 Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?, Neutral
" Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha ", Neutral
 Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol, Neutral
 Have a good day! Thanks., Neutral
 bye!, Neutral
" No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL", Neutral
 Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?, Neutral
" Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.", Neutral
 Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!, Neutral
" Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that.", Neutral
 That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens., Neutral
 That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.  , Neutral
 I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy, Neutral
" Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a ""biohazard""", Neutral
" Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all!", Neutral
" Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point.", Neutral
" Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of ""computer"" that was though.", Neutral
" Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?", Neutral
 I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related., Neutral
" I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?", Neutral
 I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!, Neutral
" that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.", Neutral
" He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.", Neutral
" Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. ", Neutral
 I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world. , Neutral
" the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's. ", Neutral
" Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.", Neutral
 Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon., Neutral
" What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!", Neutral
 What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays?, Neutral
 I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs., Neutral
 Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ?, Neutral
" I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. ", Neutral
" That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. ", Neutral
" Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it ""a biohazard"". What in the world could that mean?", Neutral
" How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. ", Neutral
" Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. ", Neutral
" Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!", Neutral
 Good morning., Neutral
 good morning, Neutral
" yeah, but moderately.  You?", Neutral
" yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.", Neutral
 the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election, Neutral
 Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time., Neutral
" I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name", Neutral
 Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election., Neutral
" The Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a California governor.", Neutral
 Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S, Neutral
 You too. I do not think its in effect though., Neutral
 Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times., Neutral
 That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead., Neutral
 Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know., Neutral
 That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember., Neutral
" Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%", Neutral
 So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol, Neutral
 They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now., Neutral
 It really does.  , Neutral
 It really would1, Neutral
" He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!", Neutral
 I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote., Neutral
 the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot., Neutral
 i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly., Neutral
" it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.", Neutral
" well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.", Neutral
" no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. ", Neutral
" yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.", Neutral
" he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.", Neutral
" yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics.", Neutral
" people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.", Neutral
 That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.  , Neutral
 I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand., Neutral
 Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957., Neutral
" It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL", Neutral
 Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse., Neutral
 Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data., Neutral
 There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy, Neutral
" That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.", Neutral
" It's something else, that's for sure.", Neutral
 I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?, Neutral
" Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. ", Neutral
 Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed, Neutral
 That's sad. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water., Neutral
 The earth is old!  Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century, Neutral
 Hey. Steven Spielberg is one of the most popular directors. Seen so many of his films. , Neutral
" Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere.", Neutral
 Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though., Neutral
" I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird.", Neutral
 All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now., Neutral
 I truly am. I draw charcoal portraits and I have drawn a picture of him. He is an amazing actor. I also like Robin Williams. I noticed he did a lot of movies about dying., Neutral
 Nice chatting with you too., Neutral
" I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old.", Neutral
" Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?""", Neutral
" That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq.", Neutral
" Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.", Neutral
" Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris.", Neutral
" That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name.", Neutral
" Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/", Neutral
 I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter., Neutral
 Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun., Neutral
" Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.", Neutral
 i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable., Neutral
 Nice chat!  Have a great day!, Neutral
 Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing., Neutral
 Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic., Neutral
 Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones?, Neutral
" That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode.", Neutral
" Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955.", Neutral
 So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked? , Neutral
 Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name., Neutral
" Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too.", Neutral
" Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"". It went octuple platinum.", Neutral
 Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16!, Neutral
" That's impressive, although I haven't heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way.", Neutral
" Yeah, it's too bad about their divorce.", Neutral
" It appears to have been amicable, which is nice. They still describe each other as best friends.", Neutral
 Step Up had a really fun soundtrack., Neutral
 But I think the critics hated it. I think it has 19% approval at Rotten Tomatoes., Neutral
" Rotten Tomatoes has some pretty high standards, though. Neither Ashton Kutcher or Jennifer Love Hewitt have been in movies with a ""Fresh"" rating.", Neutral
" I didn't know that.  Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change.", Neutral
 when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol , Neutral
" Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.  ", Neutral
 Crazy!  Jupiter is so big that it has moons that would be planets if they simply orbited the sun and Jupiter., Neutral
 Must have been an absentee ballot!  , Neutral
" It's been fun chatting,  have a good one. ", Neutral
" You know, I do to.  I feel it's better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing.", Neutral
" Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.", Neutral
" That's right, he was a master of dance.  This device apparently, helped him get that extreme lean that he did in some of his dances.", Neutral
 hello, Neutral
 That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that, Neutral
 perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting?, Neutral
 That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol, Neutral
 yep.pretty fascinating, Neutral
 Thanks for the chat.  It was informative., Neutral
" Thanks, you too.", Neutral
" Not sure... They were a good team.  I guess ""Step Up"" was a favorite for many.", Neutral
 I kind of look at IMDB for ratings... Great chat! You were excellent!, Neutral
 Yes!  Mostly when it comes to the Original trilogy.  Those are the best., Neutral
 It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following., Neutral
" I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially.", Neutral
" Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.", Neutral
 She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her., Neutral
 Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe!, Neutral
 Who?  Harrison Ford?, Neutral
" It really is!  It has been great chatting, but I must go.  have a great night!", Neutral
" I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much.", Neutral
 True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution?, Neutral
 With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents. , Neutral
 Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff., Neutral
 The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment., Neutral
 I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other. , Neutral
" When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200?", Neutral
" Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?", Neutral
 Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that., Neutral
 I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect. , Neutral
" He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work.", Neutral
 That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart. , Neutral
 I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate., Neutral
" Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete?", Neutral
 I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian?, Neutral
 A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes., Neutral
" I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse.", Neutral
 I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports?, Neutral
" I applied for a job there, but they didn't hire me. Said my background wasn't suspicious enough. ", Neutral
" Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. ", Neutral
" That man could probably sell the govt's land in Nevada for us! Well, I've had a swell time chatting!", Neutral
 Does he really? I think he's a great actor. Although I'm not sure about his directing skills as I still haven't seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997!, Neutral
" Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He's already been nominated for three!", Neutral
 Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor's Guild Awards!, Neutral
" I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he'll run for a position in the government! Ha! I'm sure he's wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a good evening, friend!", Neutral
 Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too, Neutral
" I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie", Neutral
" Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop", Neutral
 Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office, Neutral
" Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw", Neutral
 Have a good one, Neutral
" Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites.", Neutral
" King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.", Neutral
" I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.", Neutral
 I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was?, Neutral
 I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him. , Neutral
" That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more.", Neutral
" Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter.", Neutral
 He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors., Neutral
 I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised., Neutral
 I guess a lot depends on the director. I don't know who directed Treasure Planet., Neutral
 I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic, Neutral
 I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink, Neutral
 Do you know who played in that match?, Neutral
 Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players, Neutral
" They named a college after him too, didn't they?", Neutral
 I'm gonna go listen to his album on YouTube now. , Neutral
 Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983., Neutral
" Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it ""soccer"" because it was slang for association football", Neutral
 Seems like a huge expense lol, Neutral
" Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an ""obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.", Neutral
" Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school. ", Neutral
" Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive. ", Neutral
 I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?, Neutral
 The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop., Neutral
" Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money", Neutral
" me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you ", Neutral
 I could only imagine. I wonder where they keep that piano. , Neutral
 As it should be. It would be so awesome to see it in person. , Neutral
" Yes, I like the piano. I don't know how to play it, but I think that it works well in many kinds of music.", Neutral
 True. That was the one on the Hindenburg. Probably sounded pretty tinny. Aluminum. Hm., Neutral
 I wonder why someone put a piano up there. Did they play it? Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there?, Neutral
" A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano", Neutral
" Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show", Neutral
" The guitar is totally rad man. I dig it. Since its debut in 1949, the Les Paul Gibson es-175 guitar has never gone out of production.", Neutral
 He really can shred. Setting the amp on fire! Great! Brian May of Queen built his guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle. , Neutral
" True. Cornell university researchers built the world's smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell. I bet Brian May could figure out a way to play that guitar.", Neutral
 The bio-pic of Freddie Mercury did well at the Oscars. Rami Malek won Best Actor. I guess Queen is finally getting recognized by Hollywood., Neutral
" Great guitar and piano playing too. Anyway, thanks for the chat!", Neutral
" When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.", Neutral
" No, not really.  You?", Neutral
 A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by., Neutral
 Thanks have a great day as well, Neutral
 I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra., Neutral
 He was recording a solo for Beat It., Neutral
" I would love to have seen the piano made out of aluminum, it was on the Hindenburg.", Neutral
" I do not. Thanks for chatting with me, have a great day.", Neutral
 Thank you., Neutral
 I like jazz but cant say I really know much about it., Neutral
 It's an interesting genre. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing. , Neutral
 that is interesting. Tupac Shakur studied jazz when he was in baltimore school of the arts, Neutral
 thats over a 100 years ago. Jazz has been seen as a major form of musical expression since the 1920's , Neutral
 That is an old form of music especially compared to the most popular forms of music now. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts., Neutral
 I never new that . Did you know that louis armstrong ended the beatles three months on the billboard top 100, Neutral
" This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar", Neutral
 he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart, Neutral
" I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals.", Neutral
 thats interesting , Neutral
 I like pianos I would like to learn how play one. they used to have steam piano and they were audible for miles, Neutral
 That must have been extremely loud up close. , Neutral
" Hi, how are doing over there on this fine evening?", Neutral
 I'm doing groovy over here. Are you a fan of tennis? , Neutral
 What if you had money on it though? That would make it worth it. , Neutral
 I guess hair dryers were not powerful enough then. A helicopter? That's a rich person's solution. , Neutral
" People are so dependent on the Internet. If civilization collapsed, the first thing they would do is search Google for a solution.", Neutral
 We can't help it! Easy to get knowledge that provides answers to daily problems. Not there when I was a kid. , Neutral
" They are spying on us, even right now! But they do like dogs, which is pretty good right there.", Neutral
 I would become a goat there if it got me stock options. , Neutral
 It's probably mostly about personalities. McEnroe was intense. Borg was Swedish. That's enough personality for one film., Neutral
" No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it's too intense for me", Neutral
 That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since, Neutral
 So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes, Neutral
" Yeah! I guess it wasn't too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they'd keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though", Neutral
 I remember being told about it by a teacher in 1999 or 2000. Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol, Neutral
 Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball., Neutral
" I've played it a couple time in high school gym class, I wasn't that good", Neutral
 I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing, Neutral
" yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste. i love their colgne for men", Neutral
" Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours", Neutral
 yeah if i recall it went over three days or so, Neutral
" I hope not, if I was there I'd be cold", Neutral
" yeah. In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol", Neutral
" lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th", Neutral
 i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins, Neutral
" not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis", Neutral
 I never knew she was ever ranked that low, Neutral
" well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen", Neutral
 I guess in my opinion her and her sister are kinda overated., Neutral
 That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave., Neutral
" Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!", Neutral
 What do you think of Serena Williams?, Neutral
 Have you seen the Nike ads?, Neutral
 I haven't but I hear they are really powerful messages in this age of people stepping forward about sexual harassment., Neutral
 It is all about there is no wrong way to be a woman., Neutral
" Yes, ans inequality among races and gender. I like Serena.", Neutral
 I really think she is a great driving force and a good role model to girls., Neutral
" Yes, definitely! I agree. She is happy to have such a powerful platform to try and pave the way for upcoming generations. ", Neutral
 Very true.  Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?, Neutral
" Really, like a shoe?", Neutral
" Really, there is so much grunting in tennis.  The longest match was 11 hours long over 3 days!", Neutral
" That is crazy, can anyone even understand that?", Neutral
 I bet they were dropping Big Mac lines like crazy!, Neutral
" Wow, Id like to watch that.  Great Chat!  Have a great night!", Neutral
 hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets, Neutral
 i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens., Neutral
" Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out!", Neutral
" i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret.", Neutral
" That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not!", Neutral
 i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure., Neutral
 that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies., Neutral
" Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!", Neutral
 that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache., Neutral
" You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made? ", Neutral
 yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science. , Neutral
 i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science. , Neutral
 he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him , Neutral
" Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat!", Neutral
 he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell. Have a good one!, Neutral
 You too! have a good night!, Neutral
" I do not, but I am a fan of Serena Williams, ever since she voiced a character in Avatar; The Last Airbender.", Neutral
" It's fascinating to know that the term ""hip hop"" comes from the 16th century, and means ""to converse"".", Neutral
 pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows, Neutral
 good chatting with you, Neutral
 I do not listen to them too much as I prefer other types of music., Neutral
 Hello. Do you like the Star Wars movies?, Neutral
 I love them too.  I've even read some of the books and played a few star wars video games., Neutral
" Some of the older ones. I can't remember the names off the top of my head but one was a race game, where you raced in ships on different planets/tracks.", Neutral
" I know.  Hey, did you know that his wife worked on the movie too?  She even won an academy award.", Neutral
" She did some editing work on some scenes.  She worked on obi wan's death, leia's good luck kiss, and the trench run.", Neutral
" No I didn't but that's neat!  I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?", Neutral
" Those sound familiar.  Yeah, the older games and movies were better.  Speaking of older, i heard that James Earl Jones only spent a little over two hours recording his Darth Vadar lines and he was paid $7500.  I imagine he'd make a lot more if he were doing that today.", Neutral
 It really is.  The Force Awakens movie just didn't do him or Vader justice in my opinion., Neutral
 you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil, Neutral
" Okay, I got my new movies mixed up. I liked kylo ren too. What I didn't like is seeing Hans Solo die if that's the right movie. The one  I meant about vadar was the new movie about a young darth vadar.", Neutral
 No I didn't. How is that?, Neutral
 I guess Star Wars is inspiring in more ways than one!, Neutral
 I love Sony so I've always stuck with Playstation., Neutral
 I do play games.  I enjoy the call of duty game series., Neutral
 I also enjoy that game. Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?, Neutral
 I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well., Neutral
" The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4.", Neutral
 Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?, Neutral
" Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.  He would be steamed if you said, ""I have a Fortnite related injury and must sit this out."" ", Neutral
 Kickball on the playground. What fun.  David Price is the MLB player with a 217 million dollar seven year contract.  Cant play ball games.  Perhaps because of video games. He might try kick ball., Neutral
 Finding 3 million dollars worth is like finding an unlock code for life., Neutral
 It wouldn't guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier. Lol. Have a great day. , Neutral
 Have a good day., Neutral
" Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards.", Neutral
 It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts., Neutral
" It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over.", Neutral
 Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY!, Neutral
" That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut.", Neutral
" I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage.", Neutral
" That's a whole lot! They're certainly influential, I read somewhere that Arya is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the US, due to a character from the Game of Thrones.", Neutral
" I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied", Neutral
 oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company?, Neutral
" wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/", Neutral
 sometimes i wish they still used stuff like that! id be rich! haha, Neutral
" yea I wish we had single payer, my health insurance is so complicated sometimes. people shouldnt go broke over a doctor visit", Neutral
 Some candidates are pushing for it! sadly those guys dont win office, Neutral
 imagine that? haha duels in court would be hilarious , Neutral
" Well, its time to start cycling to work.  Nice chatting with you.", Neutral
" Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?", Neutral
 Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends?, Neutral
" Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control", Neutral
 I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon., Neutral
 Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party., Neutral
" Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment", Neutral
" Yeah, he wrote about every drug under the sun haha. Although, a lot of recent evidence has proven some of his theories correct", Neutral
" I think like ecstasy, mushrooms, and LSD, pretty much a lot of the stuff that the government bans.", Neutral
 Haha that's so true, Neutral
 I think they were in the Whig Party. But I don't the president. Tyler maybe?, Neutral
 They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes, Neutral
 What is your favorite type of lizard?, Neutral
 Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too, Neutral
 Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile?, Neutral
" Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they?", Neutral
 Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own., Neutral
" They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course", Neutral
 Do you like Taylor Swift?, Neutral
" I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable", Neutral
 She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too, Neutral
 Do you know about the Tennessee state?, Neutral
" Yes, I know more than most would about the state. There are some big snakes there.", Neutral
 I think it's them rattlers!, Neutral
" I had a bull snake in my yard last year, a big one too.", Neutral
 What happened?, Neutral
 I let him be and just watched him slither through my backyard, Neutral
 Was it a big one?, Neutral
 It appeared as so to me. I stayed far away from him because of how big he was., Neutral
 Did you ever about them snake whistling people?, Neutral
 Hi!  Do you watch the news?, Neutral
" I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get.", Neutral
 Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings., Neutral
 Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that., Neutral
 I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two., Neutral
 Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody., Neutral
 That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo, Neutral
 Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out, Neutral
 He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh., Neutral
 Definitely.  Did you know the red and blue colors started being used in 2000?, Neutral
" I heard that.  I wonder how many presidents had beards, I know lincoln, but who else?", Neutral
 Very true.  Haha.  Great chat!, Neutral
" I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom.", Neutral
 I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there., Neutral
" That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay.", Neutral
" I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all", Neutral
" I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar.", Neutral
" Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists.", Neutral
" Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists.", Neutral
 Wouldn't walking backwards make her stick out more?, Neutral
" Unfortunately, I have never listened to Linkin park. However, I have listened to The Ramones and they played a total of 2,263 concerts.", Neutral
 No I do not but I'm aware of the fact., Neutral
 I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular., Neutral
" That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel?", Neutral
" Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm.", Neutral
" I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe.", Neutral
" Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased.", Neutral
 I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news?, Neutral
" The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative.", Neutral
" The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in.", Neutral
 I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.  , Neutral
 That's quite a while. I guess Trump might be starting a new dynasty. Will his daughter run? Who knows., Neutral
" I would like to see some change in gov't. Sometimes old ideas have value. The only president to propose a guaranteed minimum income was a republican, Nixon.. I think that people are worried now and would like some security.", Neutral
 I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans., Neutral
 Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history., Neutral
" A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written.", Neutral
 Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers., Neutral
 I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago, Neutral
" Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.", Neutral
" I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.  I would also like to read the ""best"" of the ""worst opening sentences"" that people used to enter into a contest.", Neutral
" That would not be my first guess, but I think you are right!   Based on literature, kissing is a fairly recent development.", Neutral
 People did not wear brands on clothing so prominently as they do today back in 1986.  So that was Apple being innovative in another field., Neutral
 Me too.  You know that every human society has worn clothes., Neutral
" I suppose if the weather is perfect, a grass skirt might be enough, but it is still clothing.  Clothing is often gender specific.  Nice talking.", Neutral
" Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though.", Neutral
" That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read.", Neutral
" I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace", Neutral
 i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole., Neutral
" i havenr, whats is it like?", Neutral
 I think that might be an interesting read., Neutral
 I can take several focuses as long as I can put together what is going on., Neutral
" It has been good chatting tonight, but my dinner is ready, and I must go.  I have a great night.", Neutral
" What are you more in to - literature, clothing or gaming?", Neutral
" I hear ya, I'm really into clothing too. Switching it up w textiles and materials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in 1986?", Neutral
 There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses., Neutral
" Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We're both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can't own pets, but you are their guardian.", Neutral
 Definitely a lot more loyal and loving than people, Neutral
" She's also a lot more straightforward. She wants food, to be pet, more food, and to play with her ball. No guess work needed there.", Neutral
 Very true.  Pets are pretty easy to please.  , Neutral
 I have many years ago. , Neutral
" Hello, wow no I didn't. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.", Neutral
 Fiction works comes from the imagination., Neutral
 Yes. I like fiction. There is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers., Neutral
 That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?, Neutral
 I heard that. He thinks it's copyright infingement., Neutral
" Yes he does, Snakes are legless and carnivores.", Neutral
" Ah. Yeah, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.", Neutral
 That sounds great. There are legless lizards... almost as frightening as snakes., Neutral
" Interesting, rap is normally delivered over a beat.", Neutral
" Yes. It's original meaning was ""to lightly strike"".  Now it describes quick speech.", Neutral
 Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled., Neutral
" Funny, the earliest rap was in the west african tradiation.", Neutral
 Oh. Seems reasonable I guess. Did you know that flow is a component of rap?, Neutral
 Good morning.  Do you like snakes?, Neutral
 Same here.  Personally I'd like to live in New Zealand. I hear they don't have any snakes there., Neutral
 Seriously?  Then I guess the rest do live births?, Neutral
 Well that's creepy.  It's as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly., Neutral
 i don't know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself., Neutral
 Me either.  They say that our brains are naturally hard wired to be afraid of snakes., Neutral
 I totally believe that. i've seen things about that country on tv.  They seem to have a lot of scary creatures over there., Neutral
" Wow, that is actually a good question! I don't know. I do know that oddly enough, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards.", Neutral
" I used to.  I like the older fiction.  Speaking of, cyborgs are a lot older than we think.  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of one in one of his works.", Neutral
 I didn't know that!  So he just accidentally made it up?, Neutral
 i honestly have no idea., Neutral
" Hi, I'm Good. Have you heard of the book Strange objects? It is going to be a HBO miniseries. Many critics think it it the author's break through.", Neutral
 That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it's female characters permission to be bad., Neutral
" I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren't innately good and was sick of literature's tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps.", Neutral
" I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that ""I was never a good little girl."" Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way.", Neutral
" That is interesting. I wonder if Camille's (from Sharp Objects) beauty could be considered a power or ability. The novel manages to put an interesting spotlight on it. But, it doesn't reduce her or her beauty to an archetype.", Neutral
" Yes, that is a good point. I bet the author would like that give her attempts to avoid the archetypes surrounding beauty in fiction. Camille is neither an angel or a temptress.", Neutral
 You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US., Sad
 I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section., Sad
" Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.", Sad
 I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico., Sad
" Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. ", Sad
 Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems., Sad
 Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately, Sad
" People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such.", Sad
 Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed., Sad
 She said she was peacefully chanting., Sad
" Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. ", Sad
" Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught.", Sad
" Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter", Sad
" Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws.", Sad
" Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult", Sad
" Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members.", Sad
" It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that", Sad
 You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid., Sad
" Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation.", Sad
" Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie", Sad
" Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety.", Sad
 I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?, Sad
" Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body. ", Sad
" I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.", Sad
 Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker., Sad
" Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.", Sad
 I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack., Sad
 Hi.  I guess Channig Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are getting a divorce.  Sad., Sad
 I have not seen it. Tran faced a lot of racist and abusive language on her social media though. That's sad., Sad
" lol, no I didn't know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;)", Sad
" They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke", Sad
 That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can't believe Gene Wilder didn't watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn't want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me., Sad
 No. I wish that I did, Sad
" He won the Oscar right, I thought he nailed it, he was great on that movie, that movie made me cry", Sad
 Rich people are often cheap., Sad
" It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think", Sad
" I agree. I think star wars is getting too watered down, with average movies like Solo and New Hope. They were ok movies but not up to the quality we have come to know about the franchise.", Sad
 Yeah I think he is into Scientology. Did you know he was married to Nicole Kidman? They have since divorced.  Though they did so Eyes Wide Shut together., Sad
" My daughter is named Arya. So we definitely fell into the trend! I am sad it is going to end this year, with the last season starting in April.", Sad
 I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined., Sad
" Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state. I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII. ", Sad
" I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it can't let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties, but they didn't execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly. It is too bad only 1 governor was against their imprisonment. ", Sad
 I agree. What a horrible blight on our history., Sad
 I'm somewhat interested in politics but they just make me depressed., Sad
 Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them., Sad
" Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell", Sad
" For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest. You?", Sad
" Yeah, that one was crazy, he had a lot against him. Kinda sad. It all stayed w me for awhile. Had to take a break from the book.", Sad
 I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them., Sad
" Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one.", Sad
 In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well., Sad
 I've heard that.  Are pets also used in their meals?, Sad
 Just don't show George martin any... He's not a fan of fan fiction..., Sad
 I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process., Sad
 That would have been short sighted. Can you imagine making only $309? I would be so sad..., Sad
" I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie.", Sad
 You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD., Sad
" Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians.", Sad
" ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series.", Sad
" Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.  Baseball has some of those, but only a few total and maybe one or two on each team.", Sad
 I do as well. Sad about chester, Sad
 I agree. Such a waste of talent to go out like that., Sad
 The character was not named after the black panther party., Sad
 The earth covered mostly with water in the form of oceans. I think that the aliens might want our planet for the water., Sad
 It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV., Sad
 Stan lee was a visionary. He will be so missed. I can't imagine not seeing his cameos in the coming movies. , Sad
 I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles., Sad
" Maybe they will evolve, like the birds.  Sprout wings that give them flight.  Would think they would be more like an Ostrich or penguin in comparison..flightless.", Sad
" Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him..", Sad
" I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL", Sad
 Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide, Sad
" Yeah, but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see.  When it was all just Netflix, you pretty much could get whatever you wanted... Did you know Disney makes $1,110 per SECOND?  Wow... that blows my mind.", Sad
" I like all kinds of shoes. I prefer shoes that are more fashionable. But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years. ", Sad
" Yes, if it's made from leather, but I had to wear clothes with gator skin. I guess it's a mind game with me.", Sad
" Ok, I don't mind killing animals for food, but I dislike killing for clothes, when there are many other material used to make clothes.", Sad
" haha ya me too, sad to think that 80% of the natural forests have been destroyed though", Sad
" I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now", Sad
" Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth", Sad
" Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police. ", Sad
" Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote.", Sad
 That's sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years., Sad
 Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn't make me have faith in the system either!, Sad
" Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place.", Sad
" Wow. Speaking of planets, I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet! I grew up being taught that it was!", Sad
 There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn't have to worry about what's going to happen to their children when they send them to school., Sad
" Did you know that If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.", Sad
" That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you?", Sad
 They had a really great lineup that really underpreformed. It was a shame they couldnt perform under their new manager., Sad
" Yeah for sure! I just heard about that room a few days ago. Speaking of Disney, do you like the movie Aladdin?", Sad
 Me too. I miss him making films. I guess he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. What a legend., Sad
" That's crazy! I don't even watch Judge Judy. Celebs make too much, I think.", Sad
" As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too.", Sad
" Good, how are you? Celebrities in science are quite rare aren't they? I was a fan of Stephen Hawking. I'm sad he finally passed away from ALS.", Sad
 I would think that he is smarter. I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind., Sad
" No, I missed it, I work odd hours.", Sad
 Makes sense. I might not know a ton about baseball but i know that the cubs  are always the underdogs. , Sad
 I think I would and I wonder if he knew the value when he sold them. If he didn't that would be very painful., Sad
" Yes, and they were already down by one run. I guess someone had to be that guy.", Sad
" Yeah, that sucks. He was a great player too. Well, nice chatting with you!", Sad
 I guess a disabled student who won a case against a TX school died recently.  Her name is Amber Tatro., Sad
 H&M was selling goat hair coats and there was video footage the improper treatment of the goats., Sad
" They were found to throw goats, I understand why people were shocked ", Sad
" Animal are being killed for food, but I think there are other material can be used for clothes.", Sad
" It's a shame they went extinct. The moa and the elephant bird have gone extinct too, but both of those were wingless birds.", Sad
" Poor Yahoo. Apple has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana... I'm sad that Ask.com isn't still around. I want to have Jeeves as my personal assistant!", Sad
 Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place., Sad
" I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect.", Sad
 It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission., Sad
 Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward., Sad
" Yeah, and I still don't think it's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat. But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village.", Sad
 There was a sign that said stay away from the water but the parents let him get too close to the pond. He was scooping up water into a pail when he was snatched. Poor kid., Sad
" Yeah, I heard that he was also playing in the water. And in this case they euthanized the alligator and humanely removed others.", Sad
 Yeah well I guess Disney World built where there were already alligators naturally. Seems pretty ineivitable in many areas of Florida that we would intrude. Sigh. I feel bad for the boy but the crocodile was probably just acting in its nature because it's a carnivore., Sad
" Right.:/ And as humans we make handbags of alligators all the time. That being said,I'd be very protective of my children if an animal came to attack them.", Sad
 It is a fantasy where the main hero is a little girl. Apparently publishers were not a fan when it was first being sent out for publication. , Sad
 That seems very strange but I guess the times where different on what people considered entertainment. , Sad
"  Hello,  did you know that more than 80% of the earths forests have been destroyed?", Sad
 Unfortunately we dont have enough stat going back far enough since at bats and pitch by pitch only started getting record in 1988, Sad
 I know that 80 percent of our forests have already been destroyed, Sad
 No more helium balloons? Aww..., Sad
 I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon., Sad
" Yeah she is one of the main characters of the show, I feel sad because the eight season is the final one so in April the beggining of the end will happen. ", Sad
" Interesting, What is kind of sad is that 80 percent of earths forests have been destroyed.", Sad
" Yeah, sadly mostly human activities are to blame for that, including massive deforestation for many reasons. ", Sad
 Or our level of stupidity and move on so we don't ruin their planet. , Sad
 I can't even comprehend that number!  It is sad so many go extinct like the dodo bird., Sad
 I hope soccer continues to maintain such a healthy spirit despite allegations of corruption surrounding the league, Sad
 I have watch enough science fiction movies. It seems that other beings would be more advanced than we are.We seem to not be able to solve global warming. The earth is 71% water and I am afraid the polar ice caps are melting!, Sad
 I also read that 80 % of the earths forests have already been destroyed. Very sad, Sad
 Seems like we're destroying Earth very quickly. the article mentioned that human's existence would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds in comparison to earth's entire history. Yet already we've done so much damage , Sad
" Me too. I want to know so much more and be better but alas, I cannot.", Sad
 I dont either and I am pretty sure I am addicted to the dopamine hit I get everytime I open my phone., Sad
 I used to go to blockbuster until we started using Netflix.  Can you believe that Netflix tried to get Blockbuster to use it's online service and Blockbuster flat out refused?, Sad
" Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore.", Sad
 A little bit. I know there's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities., Sad
" Yeah, the solar system is quite peculiar, the sun represent 99.86 of all mass in the solar system. Knowing, that losing weight seems futile in the scheme of the universe. ", Sad
 It's sad that a satellite was lost on Mars due to a technicality., Sad
" Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper.", Sad
" I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse. I think it might get me into shape! In the future that job will probably be done by robots but for now, it's even hard to train a robot to pick up a coffee mug, a task that is incredibly easy for humans.", Sad
 And we are the only mammals that cannot breathe and swallow at the same time. Bummer., Sad
 And our history only represents one minute and 17 seconds if earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period. it is sad we are destroying this earth., Sad
 Paul Ryan was the speaker of the house.  He left., Sad
 I know! We were disappointed because we the cg on the previews was great. But the plot and acting were fairly bad!, Sad
 Maybe that is it! The little kids like it but it didn't come through for adults. Disney  is usually good at reaching both audiences., Sad
" I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks.", Sad
" Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year.", Sad
" Could be, very sad! I hope not though.", Sad
" He got stupid drunk before the show, passed out after 15 minutes, and then the show ended. Once he was sued, he called it performance art. Such a waste...", Sad
 Yes had read few .  but FDA has burned 6 tons of literature in act of censorship. I dont think that was a good act , Sad
 I think I have. There is a book of poems by Emily Jungmin Yoon that seems quite depressing-it is about Korean comfort women in WWII in Japanese occupied territories., Sad
" I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed.", Sad
" I'd say they were smarter.  I think the current generation only feels smart because we've got all this technology and knowledge at our fingertips.  So then, we feel like we can fill all our time with comedy.", Sad
" I missed mine too and also the chance to watch Linkin Park live, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 alone", Sad
 I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist. , Sad
 He was quite the pioneer despite the racism., Sad
" There are definitely some problems. A woman has never won best cinematographer, or even been nominated.", Sad
 I know how that feels; sometimes it seems like there's no good option. I can see why voter turnout has been under 70% in the past hundred years., Sad
" That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more.", Sad
" That is my understanding, I believe he was forced from professorship in the late sixties, probably because he was black.", Sad
" That's kind of sad, people can't complain if they don't vote,  In some countries, Australia for instance, you get fined for not voting.", Sad
" I think I would pass on that one.  I didn't even know they were still all around.  Fame can take a toll on performers; Linkin Park was so awesome, but their lead singer faced demons and committed suicide.  So sad.", Sad
" Unfortunately it seems the service at the restaurant is not so great. That is one of the most important things, for me.", Sad
 Can't say that I'm much of a fan. I was sad to hear about Chester though., Sad
 That's quite the tour. I wonder if all those stops finally took a toll on him., Sad
" Pretty sure I was at at least one of those LP shows in '01.  It's a shame that the lead singer is gone, he was from around here...", Sad
 That makes sense since when it comes to poetry you are definitely making something. I don't think it is as appreciated as a writing form as it could be. , Sad
 I miss pluto being considered a planet. It is hard to remember them because we can't use the first letter memory trick anymore. , Sad
" It's really sad how petty or troubled of a person you have to be to do it too. People put down others because they haven't learned to pick themselves up any other way, and it's indicative of deeper problems.", Sad
" The first lady is damned if they do and damned if they don't, get involved in policy that is.", Sad
" Probably not the best choice, but I'd hate it if every choice I made was monitored by hundreds of people every day.", Sad
 The thing now that everyone has iphones and can take pictures of you every second of the day., Sad
 Probably making a political point.  usually everything Presidents do is to make a point.  Can't see any other reason.  Unless the reflection was getting in his eyes., Sad
" It makes sense if that is your belief.  Can you imagine the uproar now if a President did it today, the media would be full of their assault on Christmas and Christianity.", Sad
 That is kind of depressing!, Sad
 I bet. Did you hear about Mrs. Lambert? She passed away a few years ago. , Sad
 Yeah i agree... i really hate when they build developments they chop down all the trees leaving none! :(, Sad
" Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more.", Sad
 I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that., Sad
" This kind of promise works well in a small group, but once it goes national you lose the personal connection, and some will exploit it.", Sad
 I think we just need someone who doesn't marginalize a lot of the country. That's not a high bar to get over. Our current nation is that low right now... Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave., Sad
" That is a really strange salutation but no, I am not a skin head. ", Sad
 There was a fire here in LA and so many horse were saved by out firefighters. Any other animals were not very lucky. It was very sad. We need to do more to protect animals, Sad
" It was a cruel war for horses, many, I hear Islandic horses have a fifth speed, ", Sad
" That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too.", Sad
 I agree.    The Brett Kavanaugh thing was quite a debacle!, Sad
" Yes.    You arrest someone, you take them to prison, whether it is a jail or the Senate!", Sad
 Did you know ever president has been a republican or democrat since 1853., Sad
" Truman was not a tall fellow, so might have trouble in contemporary politics.", Sad
" Yes.    If they changed the colors, do you think voter turnout might surpass 62.8%?", Sad
 Thanks and hello., Sad
 Oh Yea.  You?, Sad
 I did hear that.  Emilia clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance at the audition for daenerys targaryen., Sad
 Did you know that there was an episode of mr. rogers where he learned to breakdance, Sad
 That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements, Sad
 I agree! I heard that south korea had to pick up the bill for North korea. , Sad
" He isnt a great person, he had his own uncle executed, so I doubt that is a possibility.", Sad
" Maybe it is something that will have all have to do, Earth has already lost 80 % of its natural forest. ", Sad
" But humans have a big impacts on Earth'S ressources, at this rate there won't be any Helium left at the end of the 21st century. ", Sad
" I have heard on the news that the company responsible declared bankruptcy, another reality tv show that did not pass the test of reality.", Sad
 I dont agree that much that most countries are taking this seriously. There is china and india that are throwing garbage in the ocean., Sad
 It could get so bad that eventually we may need to go to a new planet in the future. Its sad to think that could happen one day., Sad
 It's sad to think about that. I do like that a lot of governments around the world are trying to fight deforestation., Sad
" I know! That's sad, isn't it? If our entire history was seen in a 24 hour period, we as humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds and in that brief time, we've already destroyed most of the natural forests. That is so upsetting. ", Sad
 I heard a bit about it. I know they sadly lost a satellite on Mars because of it. It's like that sounds like a very costly mistake., Sad
" That is a lot of trees!! we are seriously abusing the planet, it's curious how a day lasted 5.5 hours at the begining of earths creation", Sad
" Yes, I remember when that happened. The entire state thought they were being attacked by North Korea.", Sad
 Interesting! I guess kids in South Korea have it rough. It's illegal for them to play video games past midnight., Sad
 Most of them have pissed me off with their force-fed moronic political views.  I do miss Robin Williams.  I didn't realize he was the voice of Aladdin and the 1st to start that trend. , Sad
" Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.  Very sad to hear what happened to them after having one of the best selling album's of the 21st century.", Sad
 *Big fan I meant.  The lead singer passed away recently., Sad
" Oh, sorry to hear that.  On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992.", Sad
" Yes, as wild as scientist voting the song ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest song of all time.  I miss Freddy...", Sad
" Yeah, I""m pretty bad at coordination and multitasking so I should probably give up the idea too.", Sad
" I did not like Obi's death. When I first saw that movie, I was like 7 and cried! I was so sad...", Sad
 My girlfriend also cannot watch them so I have not really seen many horror films the last 3 years., Sad
 Very sad for the dodo bird., Sad
 Yeah he does hate it. He considers that to be copyright infringement which is weird to me, Sad
 Yeah I believe so. Poets back in the day where starving artists. , Sad
 There's a lot of people trying to take that crown though..., Sad
 That makes almost make me want to quit doing my job if that happened. But I suppose there is so much competition for the awards that you just keep trying. , Sad
 That seems crazy to me. You would think that after all this time that at least one woman would have at least been nominated. But with people like stanley kubrik and Gavin Free it is hard to break in. , Sad
" I always support a team called Everton, not too many have heard of them.  My local team were successful in the nineties but faded away, Wimbledon.", Sad
" He was a team mate of that Christano Ronaldo, I hear he's in trouble with the police now.", Sad
" I guess he's done that already, he paid $375,000 for a legal settlement, but a German newspaper found out and made it public.", Sad
 Apparently the woman in question has now approached the Las Vegas police and they have opened an investigation.  Not sure how it works if he is in Italy and they are here., Sad
 yeah. I feel bad for the way women have been treated. I am sure there are a lot of skeletons still in closets., Sad
" Yeah, that is sad.  Apparently he had heart problems. ", Sad
 After all that running? You would think he would have a perfect heart! Joe Jackson died too apparently. , Sad
" Yeah, I was also disappointed when Cosby first got accused because I watched his show growing up. A lot of women have come forward and there were lots of witnesses too.", Sad
" Sad that it happened so late in life too. I just don't know. I would think he would be smarter than that, but who knows.", Sad
 It's that high!!!! 150 movies with 100% and I can't find one I like., Sad
" They have the right to vote but not a lot of choices, since 1853 all presidents have been either republican or democrat", Sad
 Agree again. It is all about the money and that is sad. , Sad
" For sure, wish it was acceptable for more people to seek help instead of thinking that suicide is the answer. Great chatting, hope you have a great rest of the night. Take care!", Sad
 In my opinion common sense does seem to be sorely lacking in today's political climate. We are almost bordering on tyranny from both sides of the aisle. Neither is willing to compromise and those that suffer don't have a say. , Sad
 yeah seems like the divide gets wider every day., Sad
" yeah, I feel the same. no need to be hateful because someone sees things differently. Sadly, today, it seems like if you dont think a certain way, you're not only criticized but can be threatened with violence. Crazy times for sure", Sad
 Good for him! I would have given up. I wrote for a few years and it was a lonely experience..., Sad
 Hi! It's so insane that women couldn't vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that. , Sad
" I completely agree. I think there is a balance between voting and holding men accountable but still not making men the enemy. Gender aside, it's pretty sad that voter tturnout in the US hasn't been above 63% in over 100 years!!! I find it such a privilege. ", Sad
" I agree but then again when people don't have the right to vote for so long and still don[t have the right t ovote, they will want to vote on anything. LIKe 34% of black men in alamaba can't vote ever again. ", Sad
 If they were convicted of certain crimes? I'm not sure what else could prevent that other tahn just blatant discrimination. , Sad
 Agreed. India even sets up polling in forests for one voter. In America we do it midweek where people can't even get there unless they can take off work. , Sad
" Can you imagine!! Maybe a short candidate would start to win!! As a short person myself (i'm 5'1), i think it's sad that the taller person has won 75 % of the time in the past 119 years !", Sad
" yeah. Just seems like a lot of peopple worked hard for woman to ignore that right. But you are correct. Plus, it's really inconvenient!", Sad
 That is true and a great perspective. I agree that a lot of the rights americans have are usually taken for granted with the inclusion of time. Think about the draft now a days. There would be a mutany! Yet many of the brave soldiers for Vietnam were drafted., Sad
 I miss Robin Williams. He was a one of a kind talent. , Sad
 I could see him doing that. I think he really loved animated films like that. He tried so hard to make everyone around him laugh while he was so sad inside. , Sad
" Lol, yeah I think so. Once sad thing is that more than 80 percent of the earth's forests have been destroyed.", Sad
 Yes it's very sad. I enjoyed talking with you. Hopefully you have a good day., Sad
" Yeah, I certainly am not too enthused with the way things are going with the planet being abused lately.  For a 4.5 billion year old planet, it's a shame watching it get abused.", Sad
" Ok, I'll lower my expectations about the hats. ", Sad
 Do you like hockey? I'd feel pretty defeated if I was the other goalie in the 1924 Olympics who let in 132 goals., Sad
" That's me, I miss about 30% of everything we watch.  I've been on the couch as my wife has watched every episode of Game of Thrones, I saw about three hours worth. ", Sad
" Just tired at the end of the day.  Even things I want to watch on Netflix I pass out to.  Usually because it's getting close to 12am, which is when Netflix uses 33% of all of America's bandwidth.", Sad
 I like how the franchise has been sexed down. I felt bad for it when it came out the first time., Sad
 I guess they are trying to be politically correct.  Technology does have its drawbacks at times., Sad
" I think Prime might be necessary, but I know that cost is going up.  If only I had Google's money! ", Sad
" I suppose it's a eternal life thing, doesn't seem like much of a life floating around a memory stick.  I guess you could program a world to exist in.  I may be no expert but I don't see it coming to reality.", Sad
" Of course The Matrix, just like me to miss the obvious.  Whatever they come with don't smoke near it, it will just like with Apple and invalidating your warranty.", Sad
" They did beat Seinfeld and Friends, yet few people remember this show. ", Sad
" Moments, yes.  But when I think back to a period like high school, it's four years, but a few dozen moments.  I think that over time, you'd remember just one thing from each decade.", Sad
" Also, then we'd run out of jobs ... yeah the math gets wonky there.", Sad
" Yes! How scary, I read that they found the cougar and killed it. Sad how animals think they have to attack for their safety.", Sad
" Yes, sad that they had to kill the animal but best for the safety of others.", Sad
" It would be an interesting read for sure, he did led the development of nuclear weapons, the same ones that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki", Sad
 Reminds me of when Joey put all of Chandler's clothes on during Friends. I am not proud of myself for that knowledge..., Sad
 I had to stop watching it because my wife doesn't like violent shows and would get mad.. Now all I watch with her is chick flick shows like Covert Affairs and Mozart in the Jungle. What shows  you like?, Sad
" Yeah they just aren't being taught the value of reading. In the 18th Century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading of novels, now there is smart phone panic.", Sad
 I never saw the movie. Didn't read the book either. Starship troopers was terrible. I did see that..., Sad
" Yep I agree. It's too bad that the studio interfered so much with Justice League, it could have been a great movie but it wasn't", Sad
" Hi! Have you seen Justice League yet? If you have and didn't like it, don't bother buying it on 4k. Otherwise it's just two hours of ""Oh what could have been "". DC and Warner Bros really missed a huge opportunity travel a mark on the world of superhero cinema!", Sad
" I am as well. The comic genre will never be the same. He created so many characters I loved to read about, watch and even play on the Nintendo Entertainment System! Speaking of which, did you know it could only display 54 colors. Isn't that crazy?", Sad
 What a tragedy that someone was murdered over a pair of shoes! , Sad
 I cannot believe that regular people spend a lot of money on shoes.  , Sad
" I don't know about that, I do sympathize too but I don't think his mother is at fault", Sad
" Yea, earth has a lot of issue, it will be virtually helium-free by the end of the century", Sad
" I tried it out once, but didn't stick with it. I liked that it's basic features were free. I couldn't find songs I liked though", Sad
" That's definitely a good thing, considering 80 percent of earth's natural forest's have been eradicated.", Sad
 I guess no party balloons., Sad
" These algorithms are never as good as they say they are.  I use Spotify and it tries to make recommendations for me based on what I listen to, it's never very good.", Sad
" Thats a lot of kids, all of them are refugees, escaping danger from their countries, kind of breaks my heart", Sad
" I know right, thankfully theres a place that rescues them, the nonprofit LACES really does a good job", Sad
" I do think it has gotten out of hand though, a 16 year old killed another teen in Washington over a pair of Air Jordans.  That is sad.", Sad
 That is sad. Murder over a $250 pair of shoes. Senseless., Sad
 Yeah the defense claims the 3 teenage witnesses were lying.  They apparently were the only evidence.  Must have been ironclad., Sad
 the society's morality is becoming worst, Sad
" Agree.  I am not a fan of such living style.  Btw, do you like basketball", Sad
" I guess one teen had a pair of Air Jordans, and another demaded them from him. He ran away and was chased, said witnesses, and they heard gunshots soon after. It's terrible! Over shoes!", Sad
" Me either. I can only read about it and imagine. But at least them my imagination plays a part, and it's quite interesting. What if we have a mirror planet around another sun somewhere. Another planet being destroyed by humans. Well, my imagination just got sad. Dang.", Sad
" momo is telling kids to do bad things while their parents are sleeping,", Sad
" Yea, him and Kim have 3 children.", Sad
 I agree. The only reason I asked was because of people second guessing the global warming research. Seems odd to me.., Sad
 I know a little. I know banning those two books would cost me two of my favorite books., Sad
" I've never read it, but I know that both that and Twain's ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" have been surrounded in controversy because of the use of the ""n""-word.", Sad
 Blockbuster had the chance to buy Netflix for $50M and passed., Sad
" I went into a toy r us when they were closing and it was the saddest thing ever. I looked at a capitalist dismantling, literally, of my romanticized childhood.", Sad
" Exactly! I did the same thing and even then, the prices were still so much more expensive than Amazon! I tried to get toys about the solar systems but couldnt' find any.", Sad
 I would think it would be higher than that. I don't think there is enough access to libraries for the people in certain areas of the us. , Sad
" That is a good point. She probably doesn't retain much. Ha! On a related reading note, I find it sad that there was a moral panic over the spread of the reading of novels back in the 18th Century. I'm so glad we don't love back in those times.", Sad
 I think the fact something based in fact iike archaeologists discoveries can quickly become an obsession., Sad
" Perhaps, but this takes me back to silly memes and a 4.5 billion year old planet.", Sad
" In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials - perhaps they can help with that!", Sad
 Yes I can't believe more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed., Sad
" I wasn't aware of that either. I do watch and enjoy basketball though. I do think it's crazy the highest paid employee in 39 of the 50 states are either college football or basketball coaches. That's kind of sad, really.", Sad
 lets talk about earth. Its sad that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed, Sad
 That's the truth! It sounds like toward the end they both had a lot of personal things that pushed them to leave., Sad
" They were, but aparently one of the spouses had alzheimer's and the other lost his father in that last year.", Sad
" Oh wow. That's rough. On a happier note, I was reading some interesting trivia-type facts on elections. Did you know since 1900, the taller presidential candidate has won the election 75% of the time?", Sad
 YES ;) mine too. That vocal was amazing ! ;)  was... such a shame..., Sad
 I agree and I'm sure it was a good laugh. Did you know that all elections in Oregon are conducted by mail? I like going to the polls!, Sad
 I'm surprised that  the 2012 US election was the first US election since 1944 in which neither major party ticket had a veteran on it. Kinda sad if you ask me., Sad
" Yep I agree with you. I wonder if he ever got to visit the Pixar secret room. They have a secret room just for celebrities, I hope he was able to", Sad
" That's too bad, me too! I have been to concerts throughout my life though. Seen a lot of my favorite bands. ", Sad
" I've heard rumors of it, but never if it was true or not. I do feel bad for him, he never really was a child.", Sad
" Someone once told me if you did not buy a product, you are the product. I scoffed at them but now it makes so much sense.", Sad
" When you buy a product, you get something in return. If you do not buy something, like facebook, youare the product. They are selling you to others through your data or ads.", Sad
 It makes me sad that artists like them wouldn't be successful in today's market., Sad
" And in that time, we've managed to destroy 80 percent of the natural forests. So sad!", Sad
 I think I remember my spouse saying something about that. I think more needs to be done about suicide awareness. , Sad
" Yeah I agree, it is unfortunate, and Linkin Park helped a lot of people through that too, so it is a shame he had bad issues", Sad
" Yes, I think that and the death of other famous people, like Robin Williams. A friend's husband committed suicide last year. It has been very hard on her family.", Sad
" I can only imagine, such a sad thing. ", Sad
" Yes, she really struggles coming to terms with the situation. She posts about it a lot on social media. Who can blame her. She probably asks herself why this happened every single day. ", Sad
 It's sad to think that more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed., Sad
 I liked those shows too and they were better than 3rd rock. I did see friends the other day and it did not hold up. It was bad., Sad
 True. And apparently legislation is the only way to accomplish real change. The Justice Department does not have the legal authority to do anything. , Sad
" Quite possibly. Meanwhile we continue to have mass shootings every couple of months. I'm not sure if the answer is gun control, mental health policy, or both, but we need to do something!", Sad
" Probably not. At least not as long as we let the get away with stalling via ""debate"".  Apparently even the NRA is in favor of banning bump stocks, but we still can't get this through Congress. Sad state of affairs.", Sad
" That's a whole other can of worms. LOL. PAC money and special interests have so much control. Foreign countries, too, apparently.", Sad
" I grew  up with dogs...Old English Sheepdogs, to be specific.  I love them too.  just can fit a big dog in a small apartment.", Sad
 It's saddening to think that over 80% of our forests have been destroyed., Sad
" I know his older kids know, as some of them were involved with him, but I always wondered about children of drug king pins and mafia members, etc. His twins are only seven years old.", Sad
" He is always hurting himself, I believe it is the way he plays, he runs so much more than some of the other players.", Sad
" I did, (unlike the Creed concert that resulted in a lawsuit the following year) . I was saddened when Chester Bennington took his own life. ", Sad
 I have been to Croatia before but regret not going to see the ancient amphitheater there, Sad
 That would be really cool. Too bad Stan Lee passed. I could totally see him creating something like that. , Sad
" I did not know that there was more than one artist related to Batman.  Yes,  Breyfogle was very talented.", Sad
 Yea, Sad
" Yes, but it hasn't been the same since Norm Breyfogle died. He was my favorite batman artist and he died at just 58 years of age.", Sad
" It was awesome, but not as awesome as a British chicken. The NES died an untimely death in 2003 in Japan. It should have lived forever.", Sad
 Did you ever hear the story of the mute man they found in 2005 wandering around the streets of England who could only communicate by a piano? It was sad but also fascinating!, Sad
" Indeed it was! Can you also believe the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a massive box office success but despite that, it still managed to make huge losses? That is just sad, honestly! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care, friend!", Sad
" Yeah, not sure about that one?  It is sad that 80% of the earth's natural forest have been destroy. Takes time to replant and grow!", Sad
 I know it's just a robot but that makes me super sad. It was nice chatting with you. Have a lovely day. , Sad
" Not very much, do you?", Sad
" no not really but they are everywhere, especially the kardashians", Sad
" Yes, I have been to a Lincoln Park concert. Unfortunate what happened.", Sad
 oh yeah... i forgot all about that!  So sad!, Sad
 I liked House of Cards. Too bad about Kevin Spacey. I think that the show could have kept going if he hadn't done what he did., Sad
" Yea, I like her in Seinfield,sad to hear she has breast cancer", Sad
" I do, too bad the leading singer committed suicide, I loved the band", Sad
 I would hope there would be more to the story than that just being the reason but it does reflect poorly on that era., Sad
" I never liked dressing up for work back when I was in an office, not sure how I feel about those aloha shirts though, it feels a little like forced merriment.", Sad
" I've heard it a while back, I guess you can't make helium, and when it's released into the air it escapes our atmosphere, never to be seem again.", Sad
" Very true. It is irresponsible to rely on social media for news. But it is relevant in divorce, as 1/3 of filings refer to facebook.", Sad
" Hi,  Do you like learning about alternative energy?  Did you know that more than 80 % of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed?  That is sad.", Sad
 Me too! Like Water World. I do wish we had that 80% of forests that are now gone., Sad
" Yes, I think his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of state dinner at the White House. Is it right?", Sad
 mama Mia is good. I enjoy watching shows on broadway. So sad hamlet is booked like forever, Sad
" Yeah, so sad. Even though if Earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period we would only have been here for over a minute.", Sad
 I can't imagine trying to navigate marriage as a famous person.  It's sad that it seems they hookup and breakup just for the tabloids., Sad
 It's gotta be hard.  And to grow up as a child star like Michael Jackson ... even harder., Sad
" It would.  But then again, it seems you would have to stick to a fairly non-controversial cause like hunger.", Sad
" I wonder where we get helium in the first place. It is incredible and a pity that humans only represent 1 min on earth's history, yet we are causing so much damage to earth", Sad
" That duet he was supposed to do with Freddie Mercury which was canceled would have been epic, I wish that could have happened :(", Sad
 I kind of miss popular music where you could hear a great lyric without having to read the liner notes., Sad
" Not really, it's sad he didn't graduate high school until he turned 25", Sad
 I hope not!  Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century.  , Sad
" Yes, it's a really sad story. I hope the suspect, if guilty, is punished.", Sad
 That is so true. Did you know they didn't find a cause to the death of the people?, Sad
" Yeah, that was an interesting story about what happened at the Backstreet Boy concert. I do think that the people holding the event should have warned the people.", Sad
 Agreed. That's how politics usually works. It's sad. I hope that people start to understand that the law is important., Sad
" It's unfortunate. Personally, I think people should let wild animals be free. But what can I say, we have dogs as pets while others eat them.", Sad
 I agree with that statement. That would be a crazy thought to eat a dog., Sad
" Really? I guess they must be the older species around, really ancient and powerful and we are about to extinct them with all the hunting", Sad
 I wonder if Creed has ever played there. I am sure they would be sued for their performance there too., Sad
" I try to, it's disappointing to know air travel is down 10% than it was in the 1960s", Sad
 So true. I think we are too hard on young stars. It can't be easy being in the limelight all the time. , Sad
 That's crazy to think.  I've had luggage lost at the airport before though., Sad
" I can understand that. YouTube and Netflix both account for half the peak internet traffic in north America, unfortunately. ", Sad
" Yeah, The guy lived  a long life and his work will live on as long as people read comics. He was a national treasure in my opinion.", Sad
 That is a super strange law. I wonder why that is? I was saddened to learn that there are more tigers living as pets in the United States than there are tigers living in Asia in the wild. We really need to protect them better. , Sad
 Don't know.  Deep Purple played a show so loud that three audience members ended up unconscious., Sad
" That sounds terrible! I hope you are better now and yeah I like hockey too, it can change your focus and cheer you up in bad times", Sad
" It was another era, before TV and the image took over, I think he would have had the role now where the look is more important than the brain. ", Sad
" It would be great, people are stuck with there phones now, someimtes they seem like zombies, I miss the days of the great authouts like CS Lewis and Tolkien", Sad
" I see.  Also, did you know that more than 80 percent of our earth's natural forests have already been destroyed", Sad
" Oh dear, that is scary!", Sad
 Oh my gosh... I can't even begin to imagine. I am so terribly sorry. Dogs are such amazing creatures!!! What was her name?, Sad
" Sasha. It's the 3rd dog I have had to put down and although it was emotionally easier this time, I still miss her. My first dog, the golden, I took three days off of work from.", Sad
" What a bad investment decision! Way to stick it to them! I think I'd be a little discouraged if that happened to me, wouldn't you?", Sad
" Very rough. The teams erupt into fighting a lot, too.", Sad
" Oh yeah, that was a good album!  I'm told they did like 324 tours the year it was released!  Pity what happened with Chester Bennington though.... :(", Sad
 So sad. Mental health issues are too often ignored these days., Sad
 I didn't. She's truly an awe-inspiring talent., Sad
" Yea, it does regrow back unfortunately, but so does a human rib", Sad
" That is surprising. And to answer your question, no I do not have any favorite celebrities, though I would love to be one just so I could visit Pixar studio's secret room.", Sad
 That's sad. If anyone could do it I would have bet on them., Sad
" Sadly, yes.  I'm scared to drive through Mexico City, where the police corruption is really bad.  With that in mind, it's hard to think of USA cops as rotten.", Sad
" A slow kill.  Well, we do care more about radioactivity and such.  And our research labs are better at finding links like that.  If only they could better detect corruption of government officials.", Sad
" Did you know Harry Truman wouldn't get his picture taken with Dumbo, because Dumbo is an elephant which represents the Republican party?", Sad
 Shootings are really sad and they can really traumatize a family. I still remember the Parkland High School shooting; 17 dead. That was sad., Sad
" Before he became a rapper, eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist. his favorite superhero was spider-man.", Sad
" The marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth-199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book universe, earth-616.", Sad
" I love muse, but it kind of makes me sad that he has ruined so many guitars.", Sad
 That is true. And let's not forget our own FDA burned six tons of literature in a censorship act. That almost makes me want to cry., Sad
 Good point.  Sometimes it pays to marry (and divorce) the right people I guess., Sad
 Another great phrase. It is rather tragic that he died at age 52. That time period had such a short life expectancy., Sad
 Reel big fish re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label?, Sad
 Hi! Can you believe a Florida legislator's aide said two of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivors were actors? That is sad!, Sad
" I am a fan of comic books specially Marvel, too bad Stan Lee died, did you know he ended every conversation with the phrase Excelsior", Sad
 I do like it sometimes haha how about you? That is sad he was only paid that!, Sad
" It was so sad that he died last year, him along with the creator of Sponge bob himself.", Sad
" Yes, that was a sad day.  It's hard to lose such creative minds; you know that their work can just never be replicated.  It's like losing a big part of the culture.", Sad
" I agree, for sponge bob was my CHILDHOOD. I loved that show so much while growing up, it was sad to see him die.", Sad
 Yeah I bet he was very interested in that. What do you think about Japan though? Would you ever go? I would hate to spend $300 to travel across the whole country, Sad
" Thats sad, the stats are still alarming, 100 million sharks get killed every year, ", Sad
 There are other countries that exploit the shark for meat as well.There are estimated to be 20 million blue sharks killed a year.At that rate it wouldnt take long to destroy the entire population.How sad., Sad
 The rain forest needs all the help it can get., Sad
 Well Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports Lacrosse and Ice Hockey., Sad
" Gee, I don't know. Wouldn't surprise me. I don't know what you've heard about Earth, but it's not the greatest place, no thanks to us humans. For example, we've managed to already destroy more than 80 percent of all our forests.", Sad
" No, I did not know that.  He was so talented in many ways.", Sad
" Again it is a bit of a blind spot for me, I seem to have lots of blind spots.  Maybe I should get my eyes tested.", Sad
" Yes, I know the basics, not completely blind.   I even know of the Miami Heat, I live in the Cleveland area and recall the shirt burning when LeBron took his talents there. ", Sad
" Yea, it's a shame a comedy film hasn't won best picture in 37 years", Sad
 I am so saddened to hear about the van accident that caused 10 deaths in Toronto., Sad
" Yes, it was quite a tragedy, and caused a number of safety measures to be implemented.", Sad
" The fans needed the distraction and sports do bring people together. It's too bad that a tragedy has to happen for us to see a need to change security measures, but we can't always anticipate tragedy.", Sad
" Yes, they are like chameleons. Change colors to suit their purpose. I like Reagan-but that was a long time ago. The world was more peaceful then.", Sad
 Yeah. On my first dive I went like 75 and freaked out! I ran out of oxygen so quickly... I'm a little better now..., Sad
" Definitely, unfortunately I think we're the biggest predators. We use to think the ocean's resources were limitless, but that thinking with the Northwest Atlantic Cod Fishery almost killed a whole ecosystem.", Sad
" I did not know that! I think we imagine that the ocean's resources are infinite, but of course, we are running out of fish year by year.", Sad
" Sad, but true. Also, over 80% of our Earth's natural forest have already been destroyed, it's a shame.", Sad
" And sadly it has mostly been by us. If earth's whole history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds", Sad
 I like to snorkel in the ocean at coral reef and small fish. Its so beautiful!, Sad
" Yes, he seemed to make a career out of restricting the rights of women, even criticizing the  long term use of contraception. ", Sad
 That's not cool.  He made several appearances on The Big Bang Theory.  I didn't know he died.  Sad., Sad
 The would have been wild. They should reinstate that rule. I'd like do see someone come in with a loaf of hero bread. That would be entertaining to watch. Everyone has gotten so serious and is always offended these days. We always looked to sports as a form of entertainment but now it's so political., Sad
 Yeah. I feel bad for the bad rap he has gotten. He seems to be doing the right things and he is still getting bagged for it., Sad
 I agree! And he has not gotten into any trouble off the court. It's a shame he receive this hatred., Sad
 I didn't know that. I do remember getting a dvd years ago. , Sad
" Yes, It is funny to drive by places that use to be Blockbusters and to think that is how many of us spent Friday and Saturday night.", Sad
" lol Yes. They really take a beating.  Those poor horses live a terrible life.  I live near an Amish community and a lot of the retired race horses that didn't make big money end up being resold to the Amish market to pull their buggies around.  It's sad.  Icelandic horses have a fifth speed called tolt, which is basically speedwalking for a horse.  I just found that out.", Sad
" It was sad, the titanic still rests at the bottom of the sea, it's being eaten slowly by bacteria and some day it will be gone", Sad
" His success makes me feel even worse for Melo Anthony. He couldn't succeed there, he may not succeed anymore with his antiquated game. Sad...", Sad
" As a Chicago fan, I am not sure I would like him to suit up for us. I would prefer to just cut or waive him.", Sad
" they were such a great band, what a shame for what happened", Sad
 Although we would need a dyson sphere in order to capture all of that energy., Sad
" I do enjoy using the internet, but I worry the constant novelty does cause addiction.", Sad
 It is a pretty messy thing to come back from. This is usually where the movie jumps the shark (so to speak)., Sad
" Yes, I have too. It takes away everything, even things you wouldn't think you could forget like playing the piano.", Sad
 Linkin Park! I own hybrid theory. I'm so sad about Chester. Mental health is a serious issue., Sad
 I wonder why more people don't vote? It is something I value doing so much. Have a nice day!, Sad
" That's impressive and probably that or more that are no longer around, anymore.  It's sad what we do to our environment.", Sad
 I had heard that as well. When a judge made a ruling in an Eminem case she did it in the form of a rap. I wish she wouldn't have done that. Seems so embarrassing and unnecessary. , Sad
 I probably wouldn't know they were valuable...and just toss them in storage. Wouldn't that be terrible?, Sad
 It's a shame that 80% of natural forest have been destroyed by humans, Sad
 That is very sad. It's not like we have a lot of planrts we can go to close by if we mess this one up. Not like we could live on the planet that precipitates glass sideways at 4500 mph., Sad
" Thats not much at all and in 1 min and 17 seconds we have managed to destroy the planet, we are the best species", Sad
" it is, but it is also sad to know that more than 80% of the earth´s natural forests have been destroyed", Sad
" Probably not, but I guess it might be better to not make it seem attractive to teens so they will avoid it.", Sad
 We've very good at spreading out into new environments. But we still cannot synthesize vitamin C., Sad
 I feel so bad for Queen Elizabeth. Her corgi had to be put down., Sad
 It is always sad when you lose one of your furry friends. I've had to do that a couple of times myself. It's a sad thing to have to do., Sad
 The Queen of England has had a corgi since 1944. Those dogs must've been very spoiled, Sad
" I'm sorry, that's really miserable. I also don't like going through the security lines that they have.", Sad
" Yeah, I guess you're not supposed to read on a plane. It messes you up", Sad
" Yes, I have read that scary statistic. ", Sad
" Humans can sometimes have a very negative affect on the Earth, hopefully we can fix our ways and work with, rather than against, Earth.", Sad
" Yes, that does make me sad. I know that the landscape has repeatedly changed but when you see all those trees down, it's depressing. And to think that in the earth", Sad
" Humans have had such a great impact in a short amount of time, if the earth's history was a 24 hour period humans would have been here for 1 min and 17 secs ", Sad
" Haha, that's neat to hear.  ", Sad
" Maybe it was popular in ancient times, when playing with words could be seen as entertainment. Nowadays, we have Disney. ", Sad
 He is one of my favorite players all time. I was sad when we traded him but definitely rooted for him when he was on Denver., Sad
" Very true!  I was sad to hear about the death of the creator of Iron Man recently, Stan Lee.", Sad
" It was a successful movie it earned 585 million, but Robert Downey only made $500 000.  ", Sad
 That might! I know Jobs was tall! Although he was not into fashion., Sad
 So true. If it isn't chatting online they are buried in their phones while holding actual conversations. People hardly look up anymore just constant scrolling. , Sad
 I wish I could have seen it on Broadway!, Sad
" Glad you had fun, it's too bad I can't use a broomstick for a racket anymore, they outlawed everything but rackets in 1978.", Sad
 That's pretty impressive. It's a shame that the world cup hosts do not get any economic benefits for hosting, Sad
 I learned a lot.      It is tragic that his twin died at birth!, Sad
" Maybe if it was fried, but fried seahorse necks does not sound appetizing. ", Sad
" I miss the sleeve, the booklet in the CD case, playing MP3 feels convenient but cheap. Like electronic music versus guitar music. ", Sad
 Yeah which is unfortunate. I liked that they were on Netflix, Sad
" That's true. It seems like more often than not, government and legal institutions operate on policies 20 years behind the tech, like you mentioned with the court video. The same thing was echoed in the US Congress recently with the questioning of the Google and Facebook CEOs.", Sad
" That's true, and not the only way this story makes me question my faith in the institution. I suppose I'd just assumed we had more of a right to know what's going on behind the doors of the systems we the people fund.", Sad
 So sad the an owl sanctuary was needed to house abandoned owls from the books..., Sad
 That would have been short sighted and such a loss! , Sad
" I love that about her. Also, I did not know she turned down Michael Jackson to do a performance! I bet he was shocked at the time. ", Sad
 I'm sure he wasn't too thrilled about that. I hate to hear that a new owl sanctuary had to be opened up to house all the pet owls abandoned by Harry Potter fans.  That's so sad., Sad
 Yea a lot of people love harry potter. Unfortunately an owl sanctuary was opened due to abandoned owls of harry potter fans , Sad
 That's too bad, Sad
" Yeah that's very sad to hear especially in a modern society. That's one case we can be glad at how low voting rates are, I think for presidential elections it hasn't been above 63% in a century.", Sad
" Ah, same here. I gave up a while back. Do you play any other instuments?", Sad
 Yeah it was sadly, Sad
" Yeah, that sucks. Well nice chatting with you! ", Sad
" It was the typical autocratic election: main opposition party dissolved by the court, protesters where arrested, sketchy monitors (from China) . But how do you impose sanctions without hurting the factory workers ?", Sad
" In ancient Greece, official were appointed by lottery, sometimes randomness is better than a dog.  ", Sad
 I wonder if they were playing it as it went down like they played music when the Titanic sunk?, Sad
 Right?! But only half the adults in the US have library cards. I guess the half of us that do are using the heck out of those libraries. , Sad
 I did too.  I think my favorites were always the classics. I wish I had read more Tolkien and Lewis as a kid. , Sad
" I'm sure if extraterrestrials could see us, they'd be embarassed at how we've destroyed the Earth.", Sad
 Large tech companies say they are close to getting quantum computers to work. I wish we could go back to simpler times. Such a race to build things to find out all of the mysteries of the universe., Sad
" Haha, true. It's sad that as humans, we have destroyed 80 percent of earth's natural forests.", Sad
" Haha, that was my first thought.", Sad
" It was sad to see him die, I really enjoyed his work.", Sad
" That would be a better choice. A nba hall of famer Reggie Miller scored a career high 40 points in 1982. Sad thing is is that his sister scored 105 points and broke 8 records, Reggie couldn't escape his older sister's shadow.", Sad
" Yeah, I think it would be kind of depressing to get such a huge lump sum of money so late in life though.", Sad
 did you know 78% of players go bankrupt just 2 years after retirement?, Sad
" Yes, very much and also about 60%  are broke after 5 years. I think they need some financial guidance!", Sad
 No not at all.  I was happy to see Lebron and Kyrie Irving beat them a couple years ago.  Last year Lebron had no help though., Sad
 I hope you are better off than most NBA and NFL players after they stop playing... More than half are either broke or bankrupt!, Sad
" Yeah. That's why it was so smart for Tim Duncan to stay in college four years rather than jump early to the NBA. Things worked out well for him with the spurrs, but many players get injured or let go and they have no degree to fall back on...", Sad
 Its a shame he wasn't paid more when part of the warriors since he seemed to make the team., Sad
 yes.  agree.  his multiple ankle injuries played a role in the Warriors getting back to their normal selves.  He only played in 58 of the team's 95 games and basically played himself back into shape., Sad
 interesting.  good morals.  funny when Nike was pitching Curry to sign on with them the press was so bad they left Kevin Durant's name in there and he signed on with Under Armor instead.  bet that Nike rep was fired on the spot., Sad
 this is crazy...  2 years after retirement 78% of NFL players go bankrupt. or under financial stress.  five year after retirement 60% are flat broke., Sad
 sounds like these guys spend so much as players when they get the big paychecks they never save any and can't afford the bills anymore after retirement.  it would be hard for sure.  especially in the NFL where there are no guaranteed contracts., Sad
" agree, that area of CA is where high tech lives.  so expensive.  so Spencer Haywood chose to take $100k instead of a 10% stake in Nike as payment.  Imagine what 10% of Nike is worth today?>", Sad
" Wow! One thing's for sure, Steph Curry is not only a great player but philanthropic as well for partnering with a foundation that pledges to donate 3 mosquito nets for every 3 pointer he makes in areas of Africa where mosquitoes are dangers. So scary to think that such small things can kill people!", Sad
" Sad Nike of all companies were so unprepared for that meeting with a high caliber player like Curry. But he's better off with Under Armor, in my opinion anyway. That makes me lose a lot of respect for Nike!", Sad
 Well its worse for fooball players since most of them end up with brain damage so its harder to find a job that way, Sad
 You know they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 finals., Sad
 Mine do too. My 7 year old acts like he is too cool for it but I catch him watching it all the time. My daughter loves her some Jojo. The WORST!, Sad
" Yeah, the possibility of finding another inhabitable planet seems slim. We really should try to make do with this one.", Sad
 I too believe the fine is a bit outrageous. I also find it appalling that Oscar Wilde was convicted of being a Homosexual practicing sodomy. I believe that two years in prison was  a bit excessive for something so widely accepted today., Sad
" Im not sure what to make out of that, seems like he was delusional in the end, ", Sad
 Did you hear about actor Anton Yelchin getting ran over by his own Jeep Grand Cherokee?, Sad
 Yes and they reached a an undisclosed settlement with Chrysler. It went into his foundation. , Sad
" Yes there was a recall.  I think he probably liked the fact that the first space shuttle was named the ""Enterprise"". ", Sad
 I remember see it when I was a kid.  I found it sad more than horrifying  ., Sad
" I used to live in DC, you'd think I'd know.  I don't really know about these murals that people mention.", Sad
" Sorry, I don't know above that details.", Sad
" I didn't know that.  Changing topics a little, I saw that over 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.", Sad
 Isn't that heartbreaking? Especially when you consider only 30% of Earth's surface is actually land mass., Sad
 Probably. More than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have been destroyed., Sad
" Game changer, the Department of Justice due to antitrust laws is forcing disney to sell.  I would think Amazon is a bad choice to the Department as well!", Sad
 Then they end up in some rescue zoo.  Shame. When will we learn... Maybe machine learning is the answer?, Sad
 Yes 71% Covered Water, Sad
" unfortunately, 80% of our forests have been destroyed", Sad
" I've gotten rid of most my cd's unfortunately, I do miss the old audio tape albums though", Sad
" Yes that is really sad. I also worried that Earth will run out of helium by the end of the 21st century, I don't know what we'll use to blow up our Balloons with haha, but seriously it is used for manufacturing computer parts", Sad
" Yeah, as a writer, I can believe it. You spend a lot of time on your craft, and then you have to sell a lot just to break even. It seems like writing costs me more than I make.", Sad
 No kidding. We need to be careful who we idolize in this country. Dangerous stuff., Sad
 I only watch super girl on the cross overs and I do agree that Arrow and Flash have gotten a little dark. I feel like this is usually the signal of the end because they do not know how to go deeper with it., Sad
 He's the pitch man that had the beard. He would pitch the boat with the screen door on the bottom., Sad
" Hey, I heard about that!  I think it was based off the success of their album Hybrid Theory which was the biggest best seller that year.  Wish I had gotten to see them in concert!  Pity about Chester Bennington though... :( ", Sad
 Yeah. I feel like our coin game is weak! We should step that game up!, Sad
 Tupac's music is classic. I think he influenced the entire rap world. It's a shame we won't hear more from him!, Sad
 Did you know that more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed? I find that really sad., Sad
" that is terrible, considering how beautiful is the earth and how much abundance of water it has, about 71% of the earth is covered with water.", Sad
" 80% That is sad, soon we wont have any tress, do you ever wonder about the dinosaurs? crazy how they used to live in our planet", Sad
" Yeah I remember reading about that, so sad.  I heard 15 people died. ", Sad
" Yea, it involved the Humboldt Broncos team, it was horrible", Sad
" Yeah my prayers go out to all of their families, such a tragic incident. ", Sad
" Yea, it has affected a lot of people in the NHL like Capitals Coach Barry Trotz who played Junior Hockey a while back", Sad
" And it sounds like those boys were from small towns were everyone is really close and knows each other, so sad. ", Sad
" Yea, a lot of the players were from small towns around Western Canada", Sad
" Yea, that reminds of that horrible tragedy where that bus crashed with a junior hockey team on board.  That was such a sad story, and I know it affected a lot of Canadians since hockey is so important to many of them.  But it became more than just a hockey story.", Sad
" Yea damn that's a tragedy.  I can't imagine... seems like it brought a lot of people together in the grieving process.  If it's one of the national sports in Canada, I'm sure it touched many people.  I had no idea the other national sport is lacrosse, though.  ", Sad
" Too bad, he sure contributed a lot to culture, his music is in the library of congress, really sad", Sad
 The damage 7.6 billion humans can do is sad., Sad
" My apologies, I meant 2011! That was a typo I didn't catch! But it is crazy that it took that long , isn't it? Meanwhile, here on earth, over 80% of our natural forests have been destroyed. That's very upsetting to me!", Sad
" That sucks, only 29% of earth is land and most of the forests are gone", Sad
 I used to but am too old and chlostrophobic (sp?)., Sad
" Oh no!!! I went back in 2008 0r 06 and we took a bus. It was so much fun until we parked next to another bus, filled with high schoolers and frat boys. I did make friends quickly though. The HSers were asking for a stern talking to though.", Sad
" Scott Stapp got stupid drunk back stage, did 15 minutes of music (poorly), passed out on stage and then called it performance art. ", Sad
 So sad. I think he has four children's., Sad
" I like reading, never have the time though.  I could goes through books in day in the past, now it takes weeks.", Sad
" yea at least you have an excuse! that sounds rough, thats my biggest fear when im playing sports", Sad
" The idea that the executive would send her notes of discouragement is heartbreaking. And that they would discourage ""queer representation"" as a subject matter, I think is poor leadership or management on their part.", Sad
" Very true. When she stated how hurtful the message that ""bixesuality"" was wrong is something she learned from watching the media as a kid, should have alerted the executives.", Sad
 but NBA players are the highest paid professional athletes. Yes their careers are short but once they start making real money they really should use a small portion to hire someone to manage their finances. , Sad
 If they are lucky. The NFL is even worse though 78% of NFL players either go bankrupt or are under financial stress just 2 years after retirement., Sad
 Really I don, Sad
" Sad how she was in a shooting and then emerged after that, I imagine that is a traumatizing event for anyone. ", Sad
 It would be terrifying. I think that she is making a good statement but I hope that she can listen as well as raise awareness. So many of these young activists don't know the laws already on the books and how they aren't being enforced so they call for laws that already exist and it diminishes their message. , Sad
 I remember being really upset when I watched it with my parents. I do not think they knew that was coming when we watched it. I was a wreck!, Sad
" Many of the natives also died of small pox.  Apparently, all of the Australian political parties still want to celebrate this day.", Sad
" I'm sure they didn't. There's a big difference between Walmart and Amazon, though they are both hitting sales pretty hard. Amazon has a contract with the post office to deliver on Sunday. But the few times I've had one coming on Sunday, it didn't actually arrive until Monday.", Sad
 I haven't enjoyed it as much lately! I find that there are too many distractions and it bothers me., Sad
" Well, that is the great thing about local theater... you don't have such big budgets and therefore expectations! Solo shows are quite cheap and venues don't need to be remarkable! Obviously revenue is always important still!", Sad
 it was such a big drop off.  I do not know if this industry will survive in the near future, Sad
" Well, time are changing and it was worse in the past.  James Wong Howe was an Oscar winning Chinese American cinematographer who did not become an American citizen till 1943 and and his marriage to a white woman was illegal until 1948 because of racial statutes.  I glad those days have been largely eliminated.", Sad
 I love linkin park Sad about chester though, Sad
" That would be terrible so which model do you like better the S, X or 3 model?", Sad
 I think he is brilliant but has made some serious missteps. , Sad
 That makes sense. I feel bad for the artist who never make it and are so talented. Or they make it after they die., Sad
" It's definitely an extreme case, but sadly even kids who are inoculated could catch a different strain of the flu.", Sad
" At least there are some funny conversations and interested discussions, but not nearly enough.", Sad
 I use them both quite a bit.  Psy's gangnam style got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits., Sad
 A blessing to who?  I fear our knowledge about vikings is now mostly from TV shows.  No blessing that., Sad
 I'm somewhat familiar with that site but I never frequented it myself. I sort of miss the days where there were more websites as opposed to a lot of sites that seem to aggregate content., Sad
 The one downside to the internet is some of the anonymity and crime that can be harmful, Sad
 Great question. Humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2 - 3 months of having it surgically shortened., Sad
" Yeah, really.  Wouldn't that be nice.  I believe it goes back to Biblical times when Adam gave a rib to Eve.  What are your thoughts?", Sad
" Haha, yeah really.  I think of Thanksgiving. ", Sad
 Google prefers dogs to cats. their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company., Sad
